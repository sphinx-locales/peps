#: ../../pep-0332.txt:24
msgid ""
"This PEP is rejected in this form.  The author has expressed lack of time"
" to continue to shepherd it, and discussion on python-dev has moved to a "
"slightly different proposal which will (eventually) be written up as a "
"new PEP.  See the thread starting at https://mail.python.org/pipermail"
"/python-dev/2006-February/060930.html."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0332.txt:34
msgid ""
"Python's current string objects are overloaded.  They serve both to hold "
"ASCII and non-ASCII character data and to also hold sequences of raw "
"bytes which have no reasonable interpretation as displayable character "
"sequences.  This overlap hasn't been a big problem in the past, but as "
"Python moves closer to requiring source code to be properly encoded, the "
"use of strings to represent raw byte sequences will be more problematic."
"  In addition, as Python's Unicode support has improved, it's easier to "
"consider strings as ASCII-encoded Unicode objects."

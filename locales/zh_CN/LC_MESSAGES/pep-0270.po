msgid ""
"Removing duplicate elements from a list is a common task, but there are "
"only two reasons I can see for making it a built-in. The first is if it "
"could be done much faster, which isn't the case.  The second is if it "
"makes it significantly easier to write code.  The introduction of "
"``sets.py`` eliminates this situation since creating a sequence without "
"duplicates is just a matter of choosing a different data structure: a set"
" instead of a list."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0270.txt:42
msgid ""
"Removing duplicates from a list is a common task.  I think it is useful "
"and general enough to belong as a method in list objects. It also has "
"potential for faster execution when implemented in C, especially if "
"optimization using hashing or sorted cannot be used."

#: ../../pep-0270.txt:47
msgid ""
"On comp.lang.python there are many, many, posts [1]_ asking about the "
"best way to do this task.  It's a little tricky to implement optimally "
"and it would be nice to save people the trouble of figuring it out "
"themselves."

"Tim Peters suggests trying to use a hash table, then trying to sort, and "
"finally falling back on brute force [2]_.  Should uniq maintain list "
"order at the expense of speed?"

"I've written the brute force version.  It's about 20 lines of code in "
"``listobject.c``.  Adding support for hash table and sorted duplicate "
"removal would only take another hour or so."

msgid ""
"This PEP proposes a model of Python governance based around a steering "
"council. The council has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as "
"rarely as possible; instead, they use this power to establish standard "
"processes, like those proposed in the other 801x-series PEPs. This "
"follows the general philosophy that it's better to split up large changes"
" into a series of small changes that can be reviewed independently: "
"instead of trying to do everything in one PEP, we focus on providing a "
"minimal-but-solid foundation for further governance decisions."

msgid "The main goals of this proposal are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-8016.rst:43
msgid ""
"Be **boring**: We're not experts in governance, and we don't think Python"
" is a good place to experiment with new and untried governance models. So"
" this proposal sticks to mature, well-known, previously tested processes "
"as much as possible. The high-level approach of a mostly-hands-off "
"council is arguably the most common across large successful F/OSS "
"projects, and low-level details are derived directly from Django's "
"governance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-8016.rst:50
msgid ""
"Be **simple**: We've attempted to pare things down to the minimum needed "
"to make this workable: the council, the core team (who elect the "
"council), and the process for changing the document. The goal is Minimum "
"Viable Governance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-8016.rst:54
msgid ""
"Be **comprehensive**: But for the things we need to define, we've tried "
"to make sure to cover all the bases, because we don't want to go through "
"this kind of crisis again. Having a clear and unambiguous set of rules "
"also helps minimize confusion and resentment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-8016.rst:58
msgid ""
"Be **flexible and light-weight**: We know that it will take time and "
"experimentation to find the best processes for working together. By "
"keeping this document as minimal as possible, we keep maximal flexibility"
" for adjusting things later, while minimizing the need for heavy-weight "
"and anxiety-provoking processes like whole-project votes."

"The council should look for ways to use these powers as little as "

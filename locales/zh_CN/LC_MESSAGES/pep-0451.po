"This PEP proposes to add a new class to importlib.machinery called "
"\"ModuleSpec\".  It will provide all the import-related information used "
"to load a module and will be available without needing to load the module"
" first.  Finders will directly provide a module's spec instead of a "
"loader (which they will continue to provide indirectly).  The import "
"machinery will be adjusted to take advantage of module specs, including "

"\"origin\" in an import context means the system (or resource within a "

"A \"location\" is a resource or \"place\", rather than a system at large,"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:119
msgid ""
"In contrast to other kinds of module origin, a location cannot be "
"inferred by the loader just by the module name.  Instead, the loader must"

"in importlib.util.  Loaders are responsible for putting modules into the "

"The concept does not change, nor does the term.  However, the distinction"

"source of confusion.  This proposal explicitly de-emphasizes the "
"distinction between packages and modules where it makes sense to do so."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:162
msgid ""
"The import system has evolved over the lifetime of Python.  In late 2002 "
"PEP 302 introduced standardized import hooks via finders and loaders and "
"sys.meta_path.  The importlib module, introduced with Python 3.1, now "
"exposes a pure Python implementation of the APIs described by PEP 302, as"
" well as of the full import system.  It is now much easier to understand "
"and extend the import system.  While a benefit to the Python community, "
"this greater accessibility also presents a challenge."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:171
msgid ""
"As more developers come to understand and customize the import system, "
"any weaknesses in the finder and loader APIs will be more impactful.  So "
"the sooner we can address any such weaknesses the import system, the "
"better...and there are a couple we hope to take care of with this "
"proposal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:176
msgid ""
"Firstly, any time the import system needs to save information about a "
"module we end up with more attributes on module objects that are "
"generally only meaningful to the import system.  It would be nice to have"
" a per-module namespace in which to put future import-related information"
" and to pass around within the import system.  Secondly, there's an API "
"void between finders and loaders that causes undue complexity when "
"encountered.  The PEP 420 (namespace packages) implementation had to work"
" around this.  The complexity surfaced again during recent efforts on a "
"separate proposal. [#ref_files_pep]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:186
msgid ""
"The `finder`_ and `loader`_ sections above detail current responsibility "
"of both.  Notably, loaders are not required to provide any of the "
"functionality of their load_module() method through other methods.  Thus,"
" though the import-related information about a module is likely available"
" without loading the module, it is not otherwise exposed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:192
msgid ""
"Furthermore, the requirements associated with load_module() are common to"
" all loaders and mostly are implemented in exactly the same way.  This "
"means every loader has to duplicate the same boilerplate code.  "
"importlib.util provides some tools that help with this, but it would be "
"more helpful if the import system simply took charge of these "
"responsibilities.  The trouble is that this would limit the degree of "
"customization that load_module() could easily continue to facilitate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:200
msgid ""
"More importantly, While a finder *could* provide the information that the"
" loader's load_module() would need, it currently has no consistent way to"
" get it to the loader.  This is a gap between finders and loaders which "
"this proposal aims to fill."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:205
msgid ""
"Finally, when the import system calls a finder's find_module(), the "
"finder makes use of a variety of information about the module that is "
"useful outside the context of the method.  Currently the options are "
"limited for persisting that per-module information past the method call, "
"since it only returns the loader.  Popular options for this limitation "
"are to store the information in a module-to-info mapping somewhere on the"
" finder itself, or store it on the loader."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:213
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, loaders are not required to be module-specific.  On top of"
" that, some of the useful information finders could provide is common to "
"all finders, so ideally the import system could take care of those "
"details.  This is the same gap as before between finders and loaders."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:219
msgid ""
"As an example of complexity attributable to this flaw, the implementation"
" of namespace packages in Python 3.3 (see PEP 420) added "
"FileFinder.find_loader() because there was no good way for find_module() "
"to provide the namespace search locations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0451.txt:224

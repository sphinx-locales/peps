#: ../../pep-0427.txt:46
msgid ""
"Python needs a package format that is easier to install than sdist. "
"Python's sdist packages are defined by and require the distutils and "

"hinders innovation in both build systems and installers."

#: ../../pep-0427.txt:53
msgid ""
"Wheel attempts to remedy these problems by providing a simpler interface "
"between the build system and the installer.  The wheel binary package "
"format frees installers from having to know about the build system, saves"
" time by amortizing compile time over many installations, and removes the"
" need to install a build system in the target environment."

"Secondly, while some Python software is written to support running "
"directly from a zip archive, it is still common for code to be written "
"assuming it has been fully installed. When that assumption is broken by "
"trying to run the software from a zip archive, the failures can often be "
"obscure and hard to diagnose (especially when they occur in third party "
"libraries). The two most common sources of problems with this are the "
"fact that importing C extensions from a zip archive is *not* supported by"
" CPython (since doing so is not supported directly by the dynamic loading"
" machinery on any platform) and that when running from a zip archive the "
"``__file__`` attribute no longer refers to an ordinary filesystem path, "
"but to a combination path that includes both the location of the zip "
"archive on the filesystem and the relative path to the module inside the "
"archive. Even when software correctly uses the abstract resource APIs "
"internally, interfacing with external components may still require the "
"availability of an actual on-disk file."

"PJE suggests the installation database \"be potentially present on every "

"Should the package-database file itself be included in the files list?  "

"Instead of using one text file per distribution, one large text file or "
"an anydbm file could be used.  This has been rejected for a few reasons."
"  First, performance is probably not an extremely pressing concern as the"
" database is only used when installing or removing software, a relatively"
" infrequent task.  Scalability also likely isn't a problem, as people may"
" have hundreds of Python packages installed, but thousands or tens of "
"thousands seems unlikely.  Finally, individual text files are compatible "
"with installers such as RPM or DPKG because a binary packager can just "
"drop the new database file into the database directory.  If one large "
"text file or a binary file were used, the Python database would then have"
" to be updated by running a postinstall script."

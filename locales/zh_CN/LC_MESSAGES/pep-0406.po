"This PEP proposes the introduction of a new 'ImportEngine' class as part "
"of ``importlib`` which would encapsulate all state related to importing "
"modules into a single object. Creating new instances of this object would"
" then provide an alternative to completely replacing the built-in "
"implementation of the import statement, by overriding the "
"``__import__()`` function. To work with the builtin import functionality "
"and importing via import engine objects, this PEP proposes a context "
"management based approach to temporarily replacing the global import "
"state."

#: ../../pep-0406.txt:25

"The PEP also proposes inclusion of a ``GlobalImportEngine`` subclass and "
"a globally accessible instance of that class, which \"writes through\" to"
" the process global state. This provides a backwards compatible bridge "
"between the proposed encapsulated API and the legacy process global "
"state, and allows straightforward support for related state updates (e.g."
" selectively invalidating path cache entries when ``sys.path`` is "
"modified)."

#: ../../pep-0406.txt:39

"While providing an encapsulation of the import state is still highly "
"desirable, it is better tackled in a new PEP using PEP 451 as a "

msgid ""
"Currently, most state related to the import system is stored as module "

"Isolating this state would allow multiple import states to be "
"conveniently stored within a process. Placing the import functionality in"
" a self-contained object would also allow subclassing to add additional "
"features (e.g. module import notifications or fine-grained control over "
"which modules can be imported). The engine would also be subclassed to "
"make it possible to use the import engine API to interact with the "
"existing process-global state."

"We propose introducing an ImportEngine class to encapsulate import "

"Since there are global import state invariants that are assumed and "

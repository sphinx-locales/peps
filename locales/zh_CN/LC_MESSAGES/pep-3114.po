"The iterator protocol in Python 2.x consists of two methods: "
"``__iter__()`` called on an iterable object to yield an iterator, and "
"``next()`` called on an iterator object to yield the next item in the "
"sequence.  Using a ``for`` loop to iterate over an iterable object "
"implicitly calls both of these methods.  This PEP proposes that the "
"``next`` method be renamed to ``__next__``, consistent with all the other"
" protocols in Python in which a method is implicitly called as part of a "
"language-level protocol, and that a built-in function named ``next`` be "
"introduced to invoke ``__next__`` method, consistent with the manner in "
"which other protocols are explicitly invoked."

"In Python, double underscores before and after a name are used to "
"distinguish names that belong to the language itself.  Attributes and "
"methods that are implicitly used or created by the interpreter employ "
"this naming convention; some examples are:"

#: ../../pep-3114.txt:43
msgid ""
"Note that this convention applies to methods such as ``__init__`` that "
"are explicitly defined by the programmer, as well as attributes such as "
"``__file__`` that can only be accessed by naming them explicitly, so it "
"includes names that are used *or* created by the interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3114.txt:48
msgid ""
"(Not all things that are called \"protocols\" are made of methods with "
"double-underscore names.  For example, the ``__contains__`` method has "
"double underscores because the language construct ``x in y`` implicitly "
"calls ``__contains__``.  But even though the ``read`` method is part of "
"the file protocol, it does not have double underscores because there is "
"no language construct that implicitly invokes ``x.read()``.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3114.txt:55
msgid ""
"The use of double underscores creates a separate namespace for names that"
" are part of the Python language definition, so that programmers are free"
" to create variables, attributes, and methods that start with letters, "
"without fear of silently colliding with names that have a language-"
"defined purpose.  (Colliding with reserved keywords is still a concern, "
"but at least this will immediately yield a syntax error.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3114.txt:62
msgid ""
"The naming of the ``next`` method on iterators is an exception to this "
"convention.  Code that nowhere contains an explicit call to a ``next`` "
"method can nonetheless be silently affected by the presence of such a "
"method.  Therefore, this PEP proposes that iterators should have a "
"``__next__`` method instead of a ``next`` method (with no change in "
"semantics)."

"The Python language defines several protocols that are implemented or "
"customized by defining methods with double-underscore names.  In each "
"case, the protocol is provided by an internal method implemented as a C "
"function in the interpreter.  For objects defined in Python, this C "
"function supports customization by implicitly invoking a Python method "
"with a double-underscore name (it often does a little bit of additional "
"work beyond just calling the Python method.)"

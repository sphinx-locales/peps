msgid ""
"This PEP proposes an extension to the Terms of Use [1]_ of the Package "

"conflict resolution."

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:24

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:31
msgid ""
"Given that package names on the Index are sharing a single flat "
"namespace, a unique name is a finite resource.  The growing age of the "
"Package Index causes a constant rise of situations of conflict between "
"the current use of the name and a different suggested use of the same "
"name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:37

"This document aims to provide general guidelines for solving the most "
"typical cases of such conflicts."

msgid "Approval Process"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:44
msgid ""
"As the application of this policy has potential legal ramifications for "
"the Python Software Foundation, the approval process used is more formal "
"than that used for most PEPs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:48
msgid ""
"Rather than accepting the PEP directly, the assigned BDFL-Delegate will "
"instead recommend its acceptance to the PSF's Packaging Working Group. "
"After consultation with the PSF's General Counsel, adoption of the policy"
" will then be subject to a formal vote within the working group."

"the policy, and for adoption of any future amendments."

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:58
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:60
msgid ""
"The main idea behind this document is that the Package Index serves the "
"community.  Every user is invited to upload content to the Package Index "
"under the Terms of Use, understanding that it is at the sole risk of the "
"user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0541.txt:65
msgid ""
"While the Package Index is not a backup service, the maintainers of the "
"Package Index do their best to keep that content accessible indefinitely "
"in its published form.  However, in certain edge cases the greater "
"community's needs might overweigh the individual's expectation of "
"ownership of a package name."

msgid ""
"This PEP describes a procedure for reviewing and improving standard "
"library modules, especially those written in Python, making them ready "
"for Python 3000.  There can be different steps of refurbishing, each of "
"which is described in a section below.  Of course, not every step has to "
"be performed for every module."

msgid "Removal of obsolete modules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:26
msgid ""
"All modules marked as deprecated in 2.x versions should be removed for "
"Python 3000.  The same applies to modules which are seen as obsolete "
"today, but are too widely used to be deprecated or removed.  Python 3000 "
"is the big occasion to get rid of them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:31
msgid ""
"There will have to be a document listing all removed modules, together "
"with information on possible substitutes or alternatives.  This infor- "
"mation will also have to be provided by the python3warn.py porting helper"
" script mentioned in PEP XXX."

msgid "Renaming modules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:40
msgid ""
"There are proposals for a \"great stdlib renaming\" introducing a "
"hierarchic library namespace or a top-level package from which to import "
"standard modules.  That possibility aside, some modules' names are known "
"to have been chosen unwisely, a mistake which could never be corrected in"
" the 2.x series.  Examples are names like \"StringIO\" or \"Cookie\".  "
"For Python 3000, there will be the possibility to give those modules less"
" confusing and more conforming names."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:48
msgid ""
"Of course, each rename will have to be stated in the documentation of the"
" respective module and perhaps in the global document of Step 1. "
"Additionally, the python3warn.py script will recognize the old module "
"names and notify the user accordingly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:53
msgid ""
"If the name change is made in time for another release of the Python 2.x "
"series, it is worth considering to introduce the new name in the 2.x "
"branch to ease transition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Code cleanup"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:61
msgid ""
"As most library modules written in Python have not been touched except "
"for bug fixes, following the policy of never changing a running system, "
"many of them may contain code that is not up to the newest language "
"features and could be rewritten in a more concise, modern Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:66
msgid ""
"PyChecker should run cleanly over the library.  With a carefully tuned "
"configuration file, PyLint should also emit as few warnings as possible."

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:69
msgid ""
"As long as these changes don't change the module's interface and "
"behavior, no documentation updates are necessary."

msgid "Enhancement of test and documentation coverage"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:76
msgid ""
"Code coverage by unit tests varies greatly between modules.  Each test "
"suite should be checked for completeness, and the remaining classic tests"
" should be converted to PyUnit (or whatever new shiny testing framework "
"comes with Python 3000, perhaps py.test?)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:81
msgid ""
"It should also be verified that each publicly visible function has a "
"meaningful docstring which ideally contains several doctests."

msgid "Unification of module metadata"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:90
msgid ""
"This is a small and probably not very important step.  There have been "
"various attempts at providing author, version and similar metadata in "
"modules (such as a \"__version__\" global).  Those could be standardized "
"and used throughout the library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backwards incompatible bug fixes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:101
msgid ""
"Over the years, many bug reports have been filed which complained about "
"bugs in standard library modules, but have subsequently been closed as "
"\"Won't fix\" since a fix would have introduced a major incompatibility "
"which was not acceptable in the Python 2.x series.  In Python 3000, the "
"fix can be applied if the interface per se is still acceptable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:107
msgid ""
"Each slight behavioral change caused by such fixes must be mentioned in "
"the documentation, perhaps in a \"Changed in Version 3.0\" paragraph."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:114
msgid ""
"The last and most disruptive change is the overhaul of a module's public "
"interface.  If a module's interface is to be changed, a justification "
"should be made beforehand, or a PEP should be written."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3001.txt:118

"The change must be fully documented as \"New in Version 3.0\", and the "

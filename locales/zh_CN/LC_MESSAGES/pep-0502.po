"PEP 498: *Literal String Interpolation*, which proposed \"formatted "
"strings\" was accepted September 9th, 2015. Additional background and "
"rationale given during its design phase is detailed below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:21
msgid ""
"To recap that PEP, a string prefix was introduced that marks the string "
"as a template to be rendered. These formatted strings may contain one or "
"more expressions built on `the existing syntax`_ of ``str.format()``. The"
" formatted string expands at compile-time into a conventional string "
"format operation, with the given expressions from its text extracted and "
"passed instead as positional arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:31
msgid ""
"At runtime, the resulting expressions are evaluated to render a string to"
" given specifications::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:39

"Format-strings may be thought of as merely syntactic sugar to simplify "
"traditional calls to ``str.format()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:46
msgid "PEP Status"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:48
msgid ""
"This PEP was rejected based on its using an opinion-based tone rather "
"than a factual one. This PEP was also deemed not critical as PEP 498 was "
"already written and should be the place to house design decision details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:54
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:56
msgid ""
"Though string formatting and manipulation features are plentiful in "
"Python, one area where it falls short is the lack of a convenient string "
"interpolation syntax. In comparison to other dynamic scripting languages "
"with similar use cases, the amount of code necessary to build similar "
"strings is substantially higher, while at times offering lower "
"readability due to verbosity, dense syntax, or identifier duplication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:65
msgid ""
"These difficulties are described at moderate length in the original `post"
" to python-ideas`_ that started the snowball (that became PEP 498) "
"rolling. [1]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:69
msgid ""
"Furthermore, replacement of the print statement with the more consistent "
"print function of Python 3 (PEP 3105) has added one additional minor "
"burden, an additional set of parentheses to type and read. Combined with "
"the verbosity of current string formatting solutions, this puts an "
"otherwise simple language at an unfortunate disadvantage to its peers::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:89
msgid ""
"In Python, the formatting and printing of a string with multiple "
"variables in a single line of code of standard width is noticeably harder"
" and more verbose, with indentation exacerbating the issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:93
msgid ""
"For use cases such as smaller projects, systems programming, shell script"
" replacements, and even one-liners, where message formatting complexity "
"has yet to be encapsulated, this verbosity has likely lead a significant "
"number of developers and administrators to choose other languages over "
"the years."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:107
msgid "Goals"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:109
msgid "The design goals of format strings are as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:111
msgid "Eliminate need to pass variables manually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:112
msgid "Eliminate repetition of identifiers and redundant parentheses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:113
msgid "Reduce awkward syntax, punctuation characters, and visual noise."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:114
msgid ""
"Improve readability and eliminate mismatch errors, by preferring named "
"parameters to positional arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:116
msgid ""
"Avoid need for ``locals()`` and ``globals()`` usage, instead parsing the "
"given string for named parameters, then passing them automatically. [2]_ "
"[3]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:122
msgid "Limitations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:124
msgid ""
"In contrast to other languages that take design cues from Unix and its "
"shells, and in common with Javascript, Python specified both single "
"(``'``) and double (``\"``) ASCII quote characters to enclose strings. It"
" is not reasonable to choose one of them now to enable interpolation, "
"while leaving the other for uninterpolated strings. Other characters, "
"such as the \"Backtick\" (or grave accent `````) are also `constrained by"
" history`_ as a shortcut for ``repr()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:136
msgid "This leaves a few remaining options for the design of such a feature:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:138
msgid "An operator, as in printf-style string formatting via ``%``."

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:139
msgid "A class, such as ``string.Template()``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:141
msgid "New syntax, or"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:142
msgid "A new string prefix marker, such as the well-known ``r''`` or ``u''``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:144
msgid ""
"The first three options above are mature. Each has specific use cases and"
" drawbacks, yet also suffer from the verbosity and visual noise mentioned"
" previously. All options are discussed in the next sections."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:153
msgid "Background"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:155
msgid ""
"Formatted strings build on several existing techniques and proposals and "
"what we've collectively learned from them. In keeping with the design "
"goals of readability and error-prevention, the following examples "
"therefore use named, not positional arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:161

"Let's assume we have the following dictionary, and would like to print "
"out its items as an informative string for end users::"

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:168
msgid "Printf-style formatting, via operator"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:170
msgid ""
"This `venerable technique`_ continues to have its uses, such as with "
"byte-based protocols, simplicity in simple cases, and familiarity to many"
" programmers::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:178
msgid ""
"In this form, considering the prerequisite dictionary creation, the "
"technique is verbose, a tad noisy, yet relatively readable. Additional "
"issues are that an operator can only take one argument besides the "
"original string, meaning multiple parameters must be passed in a tuple or"
" dictionary. Also, it is relatively easy to make an error in the number "
"of arguments passed, the expected type, have a missing key, or forget the"
" trailing type, e.g. (``s`` or ``d``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:193
msgid "string.Template Class"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:195
msgid ""
"The ``string.Template`` `class from`_ PEP 292 (Simpler String "
"Substitutions) is a purposely simplified design, using familiar shell "
"interpolation syntax, with `safe-substitution feature`_, that finds its "
"main use cases in shell and internationalization tools::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:204
msgid ""
"While also verbose, the string itself is readable. Though functionality "
"is limited, it meets its requirements well. It isn't powerful enough for "
"many cases, and that helps keep inexperienced users out of trouble, as "
"well as avoiding issues with moderately-trusted input (i18n) from third-"
"parties. It unfortunately takes enough code to discourage its use for ad-"
"hoc string interpolation, unless encapsulated in a `convenience library`_"
" such as ``flufl.i18n``."

"PEP 215 was a former proposal of which this one shares a lot in common. "

"recent support in a number of other languages, its day may have come."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:228

"The large number of dollar sign (``$``) characters it included may have "
"led it to resemble Python's arch-nemesis Perl, and likely contributed to "

#: ../../pep-0502.txt:237

"The ``str.format()`` `syntax of`_ PEP 3101 is the most recent and modern "
"of the existing options. It is also more powerful and usually easier to "
"read than the others. It avoids many of the drawbacks and limits of the "
"previous techniques."

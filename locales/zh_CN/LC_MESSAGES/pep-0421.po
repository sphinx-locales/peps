msgid ""
"This PEP introduces a new attribute for the ``sys`` module: "
"``sys.implementation``.  The attribute holds consolidated information "
"about the implementation of the running interpreter.  Thus "
"``sys.implementation`` is the source to which the standard library may "
"look for implementation-specific information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:24
msgid ""
"The proposal in this PEP is in line with a broader emphasis on making "
"Python friendlier to alternate implementations.  It describes the new "
"variable and the constraints on what that variable contains.  The PEP "
"also explains some immediate use cases for ``sys.implementation``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:33
msgid ""
"For a number of years now, the distinction between Python-the-language "
"and CPython (the reference implementation) has been growing.  Most of "
"this change is due to the emergence of Jython, IronPython, and PyPy as "
"viable alternate implementations of Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:38
msgid ""
"Consider, however, the nearly two decades of CPython-centric Python (i.e."
" most of its existence).  That focus has understandably contributed to "
"quite a few CPython-specific artifacts both in the standard library and "
"exposed in the interpreter.  Though the core developers have made an "
"effort in recent years to address this, quite a few of the artifacts "
"remain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:45
msgid ""
"Part of the solution is presented in this PEP: a single namespace in "
"which to consolidate implementation specifics.  This will help focus "
"efforts to differentiate the implementation specifics from the language."
"  Additionally, it will foster a multiple-implementation mindset."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:53
msgid "Proposal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:55
msgid ""
"We will add a new attribute to the ``sys`` module, called "
"``sys.implementation``, as an object with attribute-access (as opposed to"
" a mapping).  It will contain implementation-specific information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:59
msgid ""
"The attributes of this object will remain fixed during interpreter "
"execution and through the course of an implementation version.  This "
"ensures behaviors don't change between versions which depend on "
"attributes of ``sys.implementation``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:64
msgid ""
"The object has each of the attributes described in the `Required "
"Attributes`_ section below.  Those attribute names will never start with "
"an underscore.  The standard library and the language definition will "
"rely only on those required attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:69
msgid ""
"This proposal takes a conservative approach in requiring only a small "
"number of attributes.  As more become appropriate, they may be added with"
" discretion, as described in `Adding New Required Attributes`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:73
msgid ""
"While this PEP places no other constraints on ``sys.implementation``, it "
"also recommends that no one rely on capabilities outside those described "
"here.  The only exception to that recommendation is for attributes "
"starting with an underscore.  Implementers may use those as appropriate "
"to store per-implementation data."

msgid "Adding New Required Attributes"

msgid ""
"In time more required attributes will be added to ``sys.implementation``."

msgstr ""

"All proposals for new required attributes will go through the normal PEP "

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:127
msgid ""
"A main point of ``sys.implementation`` is to contain information that "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:132
msgid ""
"As such, the format of ``sys.implementation.version`` will follow that of"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:139
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:141
msgid ""
"The status quo for implementation-specific information gives us that "

" `platform.python_implementation()`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:146
msgid ""
"This PEP is the main alternative to that approach.  It consolidates the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:152
msgid "Type Considerations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:154
msgid ""
"It's very easy to get bogged down in discussions about the type of "
"``sys.implementation``.  However, its purpose is to support the standard "
"library and language definition.  As such, there isn't much that really "
"matters regarding its type, as opposed to a feature that would be more "
"generally used.  Thus characteristics like immutability and sequence-ness"
" have been disregarded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:161
msgid ""
"The only real choice has been between an object with attribute access and"
" a mapping with item access.  This PEP espouses dotted access to reflect "
"the relatively fixed nature of the namespace."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:167
msgid "Non-Required Attributes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:169
msgid ""
"Earlier versions of this PEP included a required attribute called "
"``metadata`` that held any non-required, per-implementation data "
"[#Nick]_.  However, this proved to be an unnecessary addition considering"
" the purpose of ``sys.implementation``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:174
msgid ""
"Ultimately, non-required attributes are virtually ignored in this PEP. "
"They have no impact other than that careless use may collide with future "
"required attributes.  That, however, is but a marginal concern for "
"``sys.implementation``."

msgid "Why a Part of ``sys``?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:183
msgid ""
"The ``sys`` module holds the new namespace because ``sys`` is the depot "
"for interpreter-centric variables and functions.  Many implementation-"
"specific attributes are already found in ``sys``."

msgid "Why Strict Constraints on Any of the Values?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:191
msgid ""
"As already noted in `Version Format`_, values in ``sys.implementation`` "
"are intended for use by the standard library. Constraining those values, "
"essentially specifying an API for them, allows them to be used "

msgid ""
"The ``platform`` module determines the python implementation by looking "
"for clues in a couple different ``sys`` variables [#guess]_.  However, "
"this approach is fragile, requiring changes to the standard library each "

msgid ""
"PEP 3147 defined the use of a module cache and cache tags for file names."
"  The importlib bootstrap code, frozen into the Python binary as of 3.3, "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:249
msgid ""
"The cache tag defined in ``Python/import.c`` was hard-coded to "

"the same way as does ``platform.python_implementation()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:254
msgid ""
"As long as the hard-coded tag is limited to CPython-specific code, it is "
"livable.  However, inasmuch as other Python implementations use the "
"importlib code to work with the module cache, a hard-coded tag would "
"become a problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:259
msgid ""
"Directly using the ``platform`` module in this case is a non-starter. Any"

"that led to the recent interest in ``sys.implementation``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0421.txt:264

"Regardless of the outcome for the implementation name used, another "

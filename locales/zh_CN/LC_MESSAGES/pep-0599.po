"This PEP proposes the creation of a ``manylinux2014`` platform tag to "

"CentOS 6 is now the oldest supported CentOS release, and will receive "
"maintenance updates through November 30th, 2020, [1]_ at which point it "
"will reach end-of-life, and no further updates such as security patches "
"will be made available. All wheels built under the ``manylinux2010`` "
"images will remain at obsolete versions after that point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0599.rst:37
msgid ""
"Therefore, we propose the continuation of the existing manylinux "
"standard, and that a new PEP 425-style [2]_ platform tag called "
"``manylinux2014`` be derived from CentOS 7 and that the ``manylinux`` "
"toolchain, PyPI, and ``pip`` be updated to support it."
msgstr ""

"Similar to how :pep:`571` and :pep:`513` drew allowed shared libraries "

"This PEP proposes a temporary moratorium (suspension) of all changes to "
"the Python language syntax, semantics, and built-ins for a period of at "
"least two years from the release of Python 3.1.  In particular, the "
"moratorium would include Python 3.2 (to be released 18-24 months after "
"3.1) but allow Python 3.3 (assuming it is not released prematurely) to "
"once again include language changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:23
msgid ""
"This suspension of features is designed to allow non-CPython "
"implementations to \"catch up\" to the core implementation of the "
"language, help ease adoption of Python 3.x, and provide a more stable "
"base for the community."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:31
msgid ""
"This idea was proposed by Guido van Rossum on the python-ideas [1]_ "
"mailing list. The premise of his email was to slow the alteration of the"
"  Python core syntax, builtins and semantics to allow non-CPython "
"implementations to catch up to the current state of Python, both 2.x and "
"3.x."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:36
msgid ""
"Python, as a language is more than the core implementation -- CPython -- "
"with a rich, mature and vibrant community of implementations, such as "
"Jython [2]_, IronPython [3]_ and PyPy [4]_ that are a benefit not only to"
" the community, but to the language itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:41
msgid ""
"Still others, such as Unladen Swallow [5]_ (a branch of CPython) seek not"
" to create an alternative implementation, but rather they seek to enhance"
" the performance and implementation of CPython itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:45
msgid ""
"Python 3.x was a large part of the last several years of Python's "
"development. Its release, as well as a bevy of changes to the language "
"introduced by it and the previous 2.6.x releases, puts alternative "
"implementations at a severe disadvantage in \"keeping pace\" with core "
"python development."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:51
msgid ""
"Additionally, many of the changes put into the recent releases of the "
"language as implemented by CPython have not yet seen widespread usage by "
"the general user population. For example, most users are limited to the "
"version of the interpreter (typically CPython) which comes pre-installed "
"with their operating system. Most OS vendors are just barely beginning to"
" ship Python 2.6 -- even fewer are shipping Python 3.x."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:58
msgid ""
"As it is expected that Python 2.7 be the effective \"end of life\" of the"
" Python 2.x code line, with Python 3.x being the future, it is in the "
"best interest of Python core development to temporarily suspend the "
"alteration of the language itself to allow all of these external entities"
" to catch up and to assist in the adoption of, and migration to, Python "
"3.x"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:64
msgid ""
"Finally, the moratorium is intended to free up cycles within core "
"development to focus on other issues, such as the CPython interpreter and"
" improvements therein, the standard library, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3003.txt:68
msgid ""
"This moratorium does not allow for exceptions -- once accepted, any "
"pending changes to the syntax or semantics of the language will be "
"postponed until the moratorium is lifted."

"implementation meaning that if desired other implementations may add "

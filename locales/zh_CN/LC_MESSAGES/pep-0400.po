msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0400.txt:39
msgid ""
"When the Python I/O model was updated for 3.0, the concept of a \"stream-"
"with-known-encoding\" was introduced in the form of io.TextIOWrapper. As "
"this class is critical to the performance of text-based I/O in Python 3, "
"this module has an optimised C version which is used by CPython by "
"default. Many corner cases in handling buffering, stateful codecs and "
"universal newlines have been dealt with since the release of Python 3.0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0400.txt:47
msgid ""
"This new interface overlaps heavily with the legacy codecs.StreamReader, "
"codecs.StreamWriter and codecs.StreamReaderWriter interfaces that were "
"part of the original codec interface design in PEP 100. These interfaces "
"are organised around the principle of an encoding with an associated "
"stream (i.e. the reverse of arrangement in the io module), so the "
"original PEP 100 design required that codec writers provide appropriate "
"StreamReader and StreamWriter implementations in addition to the core "
"codec encode() and decode() methods. This places a heavy burden on codec "
"authors providing these specialised implementations to correctly handle "
"many of the corner cases (see `Appendix A`_) that have now been dealt "
"with by io.TextIOWrapper. While deeper integration between the codec and "
"the stream allows for additional optimisations in theory, these "
"optimisations have in practice either not been carried out and else the "
"associated code duplication means that the corner cases that have been "
"fixed in io.TextIOWrapper are still not handled correctly in the various "
"StreamReader and StreamWriter implementations."

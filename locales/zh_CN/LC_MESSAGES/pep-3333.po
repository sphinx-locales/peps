"This PEP, therefore, proposes a simple and universal interface between "
"web servers and web applications or frameworks: the Python Web Server "
"Gateway Interface (WSGI)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:71
msgid ""
"But the mere existence of a WSGI spec does nothing to address the "
"existing state of servers and frameworks for Python web applications. "
"Server and framework authors and maintainers must actually implement WSGI"
" for there to be any effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:76
msgid ""
"However, since no existing servers or frameworks support WSGI, there is "
"little immediate reward for an author who implements WSGI support. Thus, "
"WSGI **must** be easy to implement, so that an author's initial "
"investment in the interface can be reasonably low."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:81
msgid ""
"Thus, simplicity of implementation on *both* the server and framework "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:86
msgid ""
"Note, however, that simplicity of implementation for a framework author "
"is not the same thing as ease of use for a web application author.  WSGI "
"presents an absolutely \"no frills\" interface to the framework author, "
"because bells and whistles like response objects and cookie handling "
"would just get in the way of existing frameworks' handling of these "
"issues.  Again, the goal of WSGI is to facilitate easy interconnection of"
" existing servers and applications or frameworks, not to create a new web"
" framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:95
msgid ""
"Note also that this goal precludes WSGI from requiring anything that is "
"not already available in deployed versions of Python.  Therefore, new "
"standard library modules are not proposed or required by this "
"specification, and nothing in WSGI requires a Python version greater than"
" 2.2.2.  (It would be a good idea, however, for future versions of Python"
" to include support for this interface in web servers provided by the "
"standard library.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:103

"In addition to ease of implementation for existing and future frameworks "

" a server for their contained applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:110
msgid ""
"If middleware can be both simple and robust, and WSGI is widely available"
" in servers and frameworks, it allows for the possibility of an entirely "
"new kind of Python web application framework: one consisting of loosely-"
"coupled WSGI middleware components.  Indeed, existing framework authors "
"may even choose to refactor their frameworks' existing services to be "
"provided in this way, becoming more like libraries used with WSGI, and "
"less like monolithic frameworks.  This would then allow application "
"developers to choose \"best-of-breed\" components for specific "
"functionality, rather than having to commit to all the pros and cons of a"
" single framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:121
msgid ""
"Of course, as of this writing, that day is doubtless quite far off. In "
"the meantime, it is a sufficient short-term goal for WSGI to enable the "
"use of any framework with any server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:125
msgid ""
"Finally, it should be mentioned that the current version of WSGI does not"
" prescribe any particular mechanism for \"deploying\" an application for "
"use with a web server or server gateway.  At the present time, this is "
"necessarily implementation-defined by the server or gateway.  After a "
"sufficient number of servers and frameworks have implemented WSGI to "
"provide field experience with varying deployment requirements, it may "
"make sense to create another PEP, describing a deployment standard for "
"WSGI servers and application frameworks."

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:139
msgid ""
"The WSGI interface has two sides: the \"server\" or \"gateway\" side, and"
" the \"application\" or \"framework\" side.  The server side invokes a "
"callable object that is provided by the application side.  The specifics "
"of how that object is provided are up to the server or gateway.  It is "
"assumed that some servers or gateways will require an application's "
"deployer to write a short script to create an instance of the server or "
"gateway, and supply it with the application object. Other servers and "
"gateways may use configuration files or other mechanisms to specify where"
" an application object should be imported from, or otherwise obtained."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:150
msgid ""
"In addition to \"pure\" servers/gateways and applications/frameworks, it "
"is also possible to create \"middleware\" components that implement both "
"sides of this specification.  Such components act as an application to "
"their containing server, and as a server to a contained application, and "
"can be used to provide extended APIs, content transformation, navigation,"
" and other useful functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:157
msgid ""
"Throughout this specification, we will use the term \"a callable\" to "
"mean \"a function, method, class, or an instance with a ``__call__`` "
"method\".  It is up to the server, gateway, or application implementing "
"the callable to choose the appropriate implementation technique for their"
" needs.  Conversely, a server, gateway, or application that is invoking a"
" callable **must not** have any dependency on what kind of callable was "
"provided to it.  Callables are only to be called, not introspected upon."

"In general, HTTP deals with bytes, which means that this specification is"
" mostly about handling bytes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:173

"However, the content of those bytes often has some kind of textual "
"interpretation, and in Python, strings are the most convenient way to "
"handle text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3333.txt:177
msgid ""
"But in many Python versions and implementations, strings are Unicode, "
"rather than bytes.  This requires a careful balance between a usable API "

"In short: where you see the word \"string\" in this document, it refers "

"Because it's merely a suggestion to the application that it should \"rig "

"that have multiple modes of operation for caching, sessions, and so "
"forth.  In a \"multiple run\" mode, such frameworks may preload caches, "

"In \"single run\" mode, such frameworks avoid preloading and flush all "

"However, in order to test an application or framework to verify correct "

"All of these implementation choices of WSGI are specifically intended to "
"*decouple* features from one another; recombining these features into "

"In essence, middleware wants to have a \"Chain of Responsibility\" "
"pattern, whereby it can act as a \"handler\" for some functions, while "
"allowing others to remain unchanged.  This is difficult to do with "
"ordinary Python objects, if the interface is to remain extensible.  For "
"example, one must use ``__getattr__`` or ``__getattribute__`` overrides, "
"to ensure that extensions (such as attributes defined by future WSGI "
"versions) are passed through."

"Further, this necessary boilerplate would be pure excise, a developer tax"
" paid by middleware developers to support a slightly prettier API for "
"application framework developers.  But, application framework developers "
"will typically only be updating *one* framework to support WSGI, and in a"
" very limited part of their framework as a whole.  It will likely be "
"their first (and maybe their only) WSGI implementation, and thus they "

"CPython's development moved to GitHub in February 2017. All other "

"APIs that can be used to build integrations and automations. There are "

"In order to really improve Roundup / bpo, it needs to first migrate to "

#: ../../pep-0581.rst:174
msgid ""
"Fear of uncertainty and vendor lock in. GitHub is proprietary and there "
"is risk of vendor lock-in. However, this is an existing problem since "
"CPython's codebase is already on GitHub. This is also not a unique "
"problem to CPython. As a precautionary step, CPython's repository on "
"GitHub has been backed up on daily basis since June 2018. [#]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0581.rst:180
msgid ""
"Bots maintenance costs money, and also takes up volunteer time. We would "
"be shifting maintenance burden from Roundup to the bots. At the very "
"least, so far we've been able to address any bugs/issues related to the "
"bots/GitHub APIs rather quickly, in a matter of days, instead of months "
"or years. GitHub APIs are extensive, and used not only by CPython's bots "
"but also by the wider Python community. It makes GitHub APIs more "
"approachable compared to the maintenance of Roundup/bpo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using GitHub could possibly increase the triaging effort. This was first "
"raised as a Zulip topic [#]_, and also brought up during Core Python "
"sprint in September 2018 [#]_. A few solutions have been proposed and "
"considered, such as creating a special triage team [#]_.  After PEP 581's"
" acceptance, GitHub released a new triaging role, currently in beta. The "
"PSF has been in touch with GitHub to have this enabled for Python "
"organization. This is pending GitHub's review [#]_."

"Using GitHub could make it easier for people to post disruptive or spammy"

"Manually editing issue templates can be cumbersome and error-prone. "
"However, for most people, creating issues on GitHub will be a much better"
" experience than creating issue on bpo. The numerous fields and textbox "
"to choose from can be confusing and intimidating to a newcomer, and it is"
" not possible to \"edit\" a message. On GitHub, issue creator can preview"
" their submission, and edit their mistake after posting."

msgid ""
"bpo uses a number of fields to specify several metadata, and these might "

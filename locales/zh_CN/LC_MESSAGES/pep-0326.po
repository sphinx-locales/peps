"This PEP has been rejected by the BDFL [12]_.  As per the pseudo-sunset "

"suggestions, code modifications, etc., and includes a link to a module "

"This PEP proposes two singleton constants that represent a top and bottom"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:34
msgid ""
"As suggested by their names, ``Max`` and ``Min`` would compare higher or "
"lower than any other object (respectively).  Such behavior results in "
"easier to understand code and fewer special cases in which a temporary "
"minimum or maximum value is required, and an actual minimum or maximum "
"numeric value is not limited."

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:42
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:44
msgid ""
"While ``None`` can be used as an absolute minimum that any value can "
"attain [1]_, this may be deprecated [4]_ in Python 3.0 and shouldn't be "
"relied upon."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:48
msgid ""
"As a replacement for ``None`` being used as an absolute minimum, as well "
"as the introduction of an absolute maximum, the introduction of two "
"singleton constants ``Max`` and ``Min`` address concerns for the "
"constants to be self-documenting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:53
msgid ""
"What is commonly done to deal with absolute minimum or maximum values, is"
" to set a value that is larger than the script author ever expects the "

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:57
msgid ""
"Guido has brought up [2]_ the fact that there exists two constants that "
"can be used in the interim for maximum values: sys.maxint and floating "
"point positive infinity (1e309 will evaluate to positive infinity).  "
"However, each has their drawbacks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:62
msgid ""
"On most architectures sys.maxint is arbitrarily small (2**31-1 or "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:92
msgid ""
"There are hundreds of algorithms that begin by initializing some set of "
"values to a logical (or numeric) infinity or negative infinity. Python "
"lacks either infinity that works consistently or really is the most "
"extreme value that can be attained.  By adding ``Max`` and ``Min``, "
"Python would have a real maximum and minimum value, and such algorithms "
"can become clearer due to the reduction of special cases."

msgid ""
"Suppose you are given a directed graph, representing a communication "

"communication channel. Each edge ``(u, v)`` has an associated value "
"``r(u, v)``, with ``0 <= r(u, v) <= 1``, which represents the reliability"
" of the channel from ``u`` to ``v`` (i.e., the probability that the "
"channel from ``u`` to ``v`` will **not** fail).  Assume that the "
"reliability probabilities of the channels are independent.  (This implies"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0326.txt:316
msgid ""
"The solutions I have seen are to either overload None as the extremum or "
"use an arbitrary large magnitude number.  Overloading None means that the"
" built-ins can't really be used without special case checks to work "
"around the undefined (or \"wrongly defined\") ordering of None.  These "
"checks tend to swamp the nice performance of built-ins like max() and "
"min()."

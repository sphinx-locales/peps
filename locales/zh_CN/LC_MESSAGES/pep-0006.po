"Python has historically had only a single fork of development, with "
"releases having the combined purpose of adding new features and "
"delivering bug fixes (these kinds of releases will be referred to as "
"\"major releases\").  This PEP describes how to fork off maintenance, or "
"bug fix, releases of old versions for the primary purpose of fixing bugs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:24
msgid ""
"This PEP is not, repeat NOT, a guarantee of the existence of bug fix "
"releases; it only specifies a procedure to be followed if bug fix "
"releases are desired by enough of the Python community willing to do the "
"work."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:33
msgid ""
"With the move to SourceForge, Python development has accelerated. There "
"is a sentiment among part of the community that there was too much "
"acceleration, and many people are uncomfortable with upgrading to new "
"versions to get bug fixes when so many features have been added, "
"sometimes late in the development cycle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:39
msgid ""
"One solution for this issue is to maintain the previous major release, "
"providing bug fixes until the next major release.  This should make "
"Python more attractive for enterprise development, where Python may need "
"to be installed on hundreds or thousands of machines."

msgid "Bug fix releases are required to adhere to the following restrictions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:50
msgid ""
"There must be zero syntax changes.  All `.pyc` and `.pyo` files must work"
" (no regeneration needed) with all bugfix releases forked off from a "

msgid "There must be zero pickle changes."

"There must be no incompatible C API changes.  All extensions must "
"continue to work without recompiling in all bugfix releases in the same "
"fork as a major release."

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:60

"Breaking any of these prohibitions requires a BDFL proclamation (and a "

"Be a painless upgrade. Users should feel confident that an upgrade from "
"2.x.y to 2.x.(y+1) will not break their running systems. This means that,"
" unless it is necessary to fix a bug, the standard library should not "
"change behavior, or worse yet, APIs."

"Backport bug fixes. If you fix a bug, and it seems appropriate, port it "

"words like 'Bugfix candidate' or 'Backport candidate'."

msgid ""
"If there's a particular bug you'd particularly like fixed in a bug fix "

"The Patch Czar is the counterpart to the BDFL for bugfix releases. "
"However, the BDFL and designated appointees retain veto power over "
"individual patches. A Patch Czar might only be looking after a single "
"branch of development - it's quite possible that a different person might"
" be maintaining the 2.3.x and the 2.4.x releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:138
msgid ""
"As individual patches get contributed to the current trunk of CVS, each "
"patch committer is requested to consider whether the patch is a bug fix "
"suitable for inclusion in a bugfix release. If the patch is considered "
"suitable, the committer can either commit the release to the maintenance "
"branch, or else mark the patch in the commit message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:144
msgid ""
"In addition, anyone from the Python community is free to suggest patches "
"for inclusion. Patches may be submitted specifically for bugfix releases;"
" they should follow the guidelines in PEP 3 [2]_. In general, though, "
"it's probably better that a bug in a specific release also be fixed on "
"the HEAD as well as the branch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:150
msgid ""
"The Patch Czar decides when there are a sufficient number of patches to "
"warrant a release. The release gets packaged up, including a Windows "
"installer, and made public. If any new bugs are found, they must be fixed"
" immediately and a new bugfix release publicized (with an incremented "
"version number). For the 2.3.x cycle, the Patch Czar (Anthony) has been "
"trying for a release approximately every six months, but this should not "
"be considered binding in any way on any future releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:159
msgid ""
"Bug fix releases are expected to occur at an interval of roughly six "
"months. This is only a guideline, however - obviously, if a major bug is "
"found, a bugfix release may be appropriate sooner. In general, only the "
"N-1 release will be under active maintenance at any time. That is, during"
" Python 2.4's development, Python 2.3 gets bugfix releases. If, however, "
"someone qualified wishes to continue the work to maintain an older "
"release, they should be encouraged."

msgid ""
"This PEP started life as a proposal on comp.lang.python.  The original "
"version suggested a single patch for the N-1 release to be released "
"concurrently with the N release.  The original version also argued for "
"sticking with a strict bug fix policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:194
msgid ""
"Following feedback from the BDFL and others, the draft PEP was written "
"containing an expanded bugfix release cycle that permitted any previous "
"major release to obtain patches and also relaxed the strict bug fix "
"requirement (mainly due to the example of PEP 235 [3]_, which could be "
"argued as either a bug fix or a feature)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:200
msgid ""
"Discussion then mostly moved to python-dev, where BDFL finally issued a "
"proclamation basing the Python bugfix release process on Tcl's, which "
"essentially returned to the original proposal in terms of being only the "
"N-1 release and only bug fixes, but allowing multiple bugfix releases "
"until release N is published."

#: ../../pep-0006.txt:206

"Anthony Baxter then took this PEP and revised it, based on lessons from "
"the 2.3 release cycle."

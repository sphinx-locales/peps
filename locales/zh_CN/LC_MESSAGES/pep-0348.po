"Python, as of version 2.4, has 38 exceptions (including warnings) in the "
"built-in namespace in a rather shallow hierarchy.  These classes have "
"come about over the years without a chance to learn from experience.  "
"This PEP proposes doing a reorganization of the hierarchy for Python 3.0 "
"when backwards-compatibility is not as much of an issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:27
msgid ""
"Along with this reorganization, adding a requirement that all objects "
"passed to a ``raise`` statement must inherit from a specific superclass "
"is proposed.  This is to have guarantees about the basic interface of "
"exceptions and to further enhance the natural hierarchy of exceptions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:33
msgid ""
"Lastly, bare ``except`` clauses will be changed to be semantically "
"equivalent to ``except Exception``.  Most people currently use bare "

"reorganization becomes a viable default."

msgid ""
"Exceptions are a critical part of Python.  While exceptions are "
"traditionally used to signal errors in a program, they have also grown to"
" be used for flow control for things such as iterators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:46
msgid ""
"While their importance is great, there is a lack of structure to them. "
"This stems from the fact that any object can be raised as an exception.  "
"Because of this you have no guarantee in terms of what kind of object "
"will be raised, destroying any possible hierarchy raised objects might "
"adhere to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:52
msgid ""
"But exceptions do have a hierarchy, showing the severity of the "
"exception.  The hierarchy also groups related exceptions together to "
"simplify catching them in ``except`` clauses.  To allow people to be able"
" to rely on this hierarchy, a common superclass that all raise objects "
"must inherit from is being proposed.  It also allows guarantees about the"
" interface to raised objects to be made (see PEP 344 [#PEP344]_).  A "
"discussion about all of this has occurred before on python-dev "
"[#Summary2004-08-01]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:61
msgid ""
"As bare ``except`` clauses stand now, they catch *all* exceptions. While "
"this can be handy, it is rather overreaching for the common case.  Thanks"
" to having a required superclass, catching all exceptions is as easy as "
"catching just one specific exception. This allows bare ``except`` clauses"
" to be used for a more useful purpose. Once again, this has been "
"discussed on python-dev [#python-dev3]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:69
msgid ""
"Finally, slight changes to the exception hierarchy will make it much more"
" reasonable in terms of structure.  By minor rearranging exceptions that "
"should not typically be caught can be allowed to propagate to the top of "
"the execution stack, terminating the interpreter as intended."

msgid "Philosophy of Reorganization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:79
msgid ""
"For the reorganization of the hierarchy, there was a general philosophy "
"followed that developed from discussion of earlier drafts of this PEP "
"[#python-dev-thread1]_, [#python-dev-thread2]_, [#python-dev-thread3]_, "
"[#python-dev-thread4]_, [#python-dev-thread5]_, [#python-dev-thread6]_. "
"First and foremost was to not break anything that works.  This meant that"
" renaming exceptions was out of the question unless the name was deemed "
"severely bad.  This also meant no removal of exceptions unless they were "
"viewed as truly misplaced. The introduction of new exceptions were only "
"done in situations where there might be a use for catching a superclass "
"of a category of exceptions.  Lastly, existing exceptions would have "
"their inheritance tree changed only if it was felt they were truly "
"misplaced to begin with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:94
msgid ""
"For all new exceptions, the proper suffix had to be chosen.  For those "
"that signal an error, \"Error\" is to be used.  If the exception is a "
"warning, then \"Warning\".  \"Exception\" is to be used when none of the "
"other suffixes are proper to use and no specific suffix is a better fit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:100
msgid ""
"After that it came down to choosing which exceptions should and should "
"not inherit from Exception.  This was for the purpose of making bare "
"``except`` clauses more useful."

"Lastly, the entire existing hierarchy had to inherit from the new "
"exception meant to act as the required superclass for all exceptions to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0348.txt:112

"Exceptions flagged with \"stricter inheritance\" will no longer inherit "

"A more thorough explanation of terms is needed when discussing "

"Direct inheritance of BaseException is not expected, and will be "

"Python 2.3 added a number of simple date and time types in the "
"``datetime`` module.  There's no support for parsing strings in various "
"formats and returning a corresponding instance of one of the types. This "
"PEP proposes adding a family of predefined parsing function for several "
"commonly used date and time formats, and a facility for generic parsing."

"The types provided by the ``datetime`` module all have ``.isoformat()`` "
"and ``.ctime()`` methods that return string representations of a time, "
"and the ``.strftime()`` method can be used to construct new formats.  "
"There are a number of additional commonly-used formats that would be "
"useful to have as part of the standard library; this PEP also suggests "
"how to add them."

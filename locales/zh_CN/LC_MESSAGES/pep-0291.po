"This PEP describes the packages and modules in the Python 2 standard "
"library which should remain backward compatible with previous versions of"
" Python.  If a package is not listed here, then it need only remain "
"compatible with the version of Python it is distributed with."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0291.txt:29
msgid ""
"Authors have various reasons why packages and modules should continue to "
"work with previous versions of Python.  In order to maintain backward "
"compatibility for these modules while moving the rest of the standard "
"library forward, it is necessary to know which modules can be modified "
"and which should use old and possibly deprecated features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0291.txt:36
msgid ""
"Generally, authors should attempt to keep changes backward compatible "
"with the previous released version of Python in order to make bug fixes "
"easier to backport."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0291.txt:40
msgid ""
"In addition to a package or module being listed in this PEP, authors must"
" add a comment at the top of each file documenting the compatibility "
"requirement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0291.txt:44
msgid ""
"When a major version of Python is released, a Subversion branch is "
"created for continued maintenance and bug fix releases.  A package "
"version on a branch may have a different compatibility requirement than "
"the same package on the trunk (i.e. current bleeding-edge development).  "
"Where appropriate, these branch compatibilities are listed below."

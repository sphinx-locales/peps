"This PEP proposes to add to Python a mechanism to automatically recognize"
" a ``__pypackages__`` directory and prefer importing packages installed "
"in this location over user or global site-packages. This will avoid the "
"steps to create, activate or deactivate \"virtual environments\". Python "
"will use the ``__pypackages__`` from the base directory of the script "
"when present."

msgid ""
"Python virtual environments have become an essential part of development "
"and teaching workflow in the community, but at the same time, they create"
" a barrier to entry for many. The following are a few of the issues "
"people run into while being introduced to Python (or programming for the "
"first time)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0582.rst:34
msgid ""
"How virtual environments work is a lot of information for anyone new. It "
"takes a lot of extra time and effort to explain them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0582.rst:37
msgid ""
"Different platforms and shell environments require different sets of "
"commands to activate the virtual environments. Any workshop or teaching "
"environment with people coming with different operating systems installed"
" on their laptops create a lot of confusion among the participants."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0582.rst:42
msgid ""
"Virtual environments need to be activated on each opened terminal. If "
"someone creates/opens a new terminal, that by default does not get the "
"same environment as in a previous terminal with virtual environment "
"activated."

"When the Python binary is executed, it attempts to determine its prefix "
"(as stored in ``sys.prefix``), which is then used to find the standard "
"library and other key files, and by the ``site`` module to determine the "
"location of the ``site-package`` directories.  Currently the prefix is "
"found -- assuming ``PYTHONHOME`` is not set -- by first walking up the "
"filesystem tree looking for a marker file (``os.py``) that signifies the "
"presence of the standard library, and if none is found, falling back to "
"the build-time prefix hard coded in the binary. The result of this "
"process is the contents of ``sys.path`` - a list of locations that the "
"Python import system will search for modules."

#: ../../pep-0582.rst:60
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes to add a new step in this process. If a "
"``__pypackages__`` directory is found in the current working directory, "
"then it will be included in ``sys.path`` after the current working "
"directory and just before the system site-packages. This way, if the "
"Python executable starts in the given project directory, it will "
"automatically find all the dependencies inside of ``__pypackages__``."

msgid ""
"In case of Python scripts, Python will try to find ``__pypackages__`` in "

" version directory inside), then it will be used, otherwise Python will "
"behave as it does currently."

"If any package management tool finds the same ``__pypackages__`` "

msgid ""
"Projects that use a source management system can include a "
"``__pypackages__`` directory (empty or with e.g. a file like "
"``.gitignore``). After doing a fresh check out the source code, a tool "
"like ``pip`` can be used to install the required dependencies directly "
"into this directory."

"For invoking a script, Python will try to find a ``__pypackages__`` "
"inside of the directory that the script resides[1]_, ``/usr/bin``.  The "
"same will happen in case of the last example, where we are executing "
"``/usr/bin/ansible`` from inside of the ``foo`` directory. In both cases,"
" it will **not** use the ``__pypackages__`` in the current working "
"directory."

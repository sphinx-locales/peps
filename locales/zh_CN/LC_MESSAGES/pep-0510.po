msgid ""
"This PEP was rejected by its author since the design didn't show any "

"Add functions to the Python C API to specialize pure Python functions: "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:33
msgid "Python semantics"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:35
msgid ""
"Python is hard to optimize because almost everything is mutable: builtin "
"functions, function code, global variables, local variables, ... can be "
"modified at runtime. Implement optimizations respecting the Python "
"semantics requires to detect when \"something changes\", we will call "
"these checks \"guards\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:41
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes to add a public API to the Python C API to add "
"specialized codes with guards to a function. When the function is called,"
" a specialized code is used if nothing changed, otherwise use the "
"original bytecode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:46
msgid ""
"Even if guards help to respect most parts of the Python semantics, it's "
"hard to optimize Python without making subtle changes on the exact "
"behaviour. CPython has a long history and many applications rely on "
"implementation details. A compromise must be found between \"everything "
"is mutable\" and performance."

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:65
msgid ""
"Numba is specific to numerical computation.  Pyston and Pyjion are still "
"young.  PyPy is the most complete Python interpreter, it is generally "
"faster than CPython in micro- and many macro-benchmarks and has a very "
"good compatibility with CPython (it respects the Python semantics). There"
" are still issues with Python JIT compilers which avoid them to be widely"
" used instead of CPython."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:72
msgid ""
"Many popular libraries like numpy, PyGTK, PyQt, PySide and wxPython are "
"implemented in C or C++ and use the Python C API. To have a small memory "
"footprint and better performances, Python JIT compilers do not use "
"reference counting to use a faster garbage collector, do not use C "
"structures of CPython objects and manage memory allocations differently. "
"PyPy has a ``cpyext`` module which emulates the Python C API but it has "
"worse performances than CPython and does not support the full Python C "
"API."

msgid ""
"Even if PyPy has a very good compatibility with Python, some modules are "
"still not compatible with PyPy: see `PyPy Compatibility Wiki "
"<https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/Home>`_. The incomplete "
"support of the Python C API is part of this problem. There are also "
"subtle differences between PyPy and CPython like reference counting: "
"object destructors are always called in PyPy, but can be called \"later\""
" than in CPython. Using context managers helps to control when resources "
"are released."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0510.txt:98
msgid ""
"When Python is used as a scripting program for programs running less than"
" 1 minute, JIT compilers can be slower because their startup time is "
"higher and the JIT compiler takes time to optimize the code. For example,"
" most Mercurial commands take a few seconds."

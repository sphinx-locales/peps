msgid ""
"The Windows installers for Python include a launcher that locates the "
"correct Python interpreter to run (see PEP 397).  However, the launcher "
"is not aware of virtual environments (virtualenv [1]_ or PEP 405 based), "
"and so cannot be used to run commands from the active virtualenv."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:24
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes making the launcher \"virtualenv aware\".  This means "
"that when run without specifying an explicit Python interpreter to use, "
"the launcher will use the currently active virtualenv, if any, before "
"falling back to the configured default Python."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:33
msgid ""
"Windows users with multiple copies of Python installed need a means of "
"selecting which one to use.  The Python launcher provides this facility "
"by means of a ``py`` command that can be used to run either a configured "
"\"default\" Python or a specific interpreter, by means of command line "
"arguments.  So typical usage would be::"

msgid ""
"When using virtual environments, the ``py`` launcher is unaware that a "
"virtualenv is active, and will continue to use the system Python.  So "
"different command invocations are needed to run the same commands in a "
"virtualenv::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:60
msgid ""
"Having to use different commands is error-prone, and in many cases the "
"error is difficult to spot immediately. The PEP proposes making the "
"``py`` command usable with virtual environments, so that the first form "
"of command can be used in all cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:67
msgid "Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:69
msgid ""
"Both ``virtualenv`` and the core ``venv`` module set an environment "
"variable ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` when activating a virtualenv.  This PEP proposes"
" that the launcher checks for the ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` environment variable "
"whenever it would run the \"default\" Python interpreter for the system "
"(i.e., when no specific version flags such as ``py -2.7`` are used) and "
"if present, run the Python interpreter for the virtualenv rather than the"
" default system Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:77
msgid ""
"The \"default\" Python interpreter referred to above is (as per PEP 397) "
"either the latest version of Python installed on the system, or a version"
" configured via the ``py.ini`` configuration file.  When the user "
"specifies an explicit Python version on the command line, this will "
"always be used (as at present)."

msgid "Impact on Script Launching"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:88
msgid ""
"As well as interactive use, the launcher is used as the Windows file "
"association for Python scripts.  In that case, a \"shebang\" (``#!``) "
"line at the start of the script is used to identify the interpreter to "
"run.  A fully-qualified path can be used, or a version-specific Python "
"(``python3`` or ``python2``, or even ``python3.5``), or the generic "
"``python``, which means to use the default interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:95
msgid ""
"The launcher also looks for the specific shebang line ``#!/usr/bin/env "
"python``. On Unix, the ``env`` program searches for a command on "
"``$PATH`` and runs the command so located. Similarly, with this shebang "
"line, the launcher will look for a copy of ``python.exe`` on the user's "
"current ``%PATH%`` and will run that copy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:101
msgid ""
"As activating a virtualenv means that it is added to ``PATH``, no special"
" handling is needed to run scripts with the active virtualenv - they just"
" need to use the ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` shebang line, exactly as on "
"Unix. (If there is no activated virtualenv, and no ``python.exe`` on "
"``PATH``, the launcher will look for a default Python exactly as if the "
"shebang line had said ``#!python``)."

#: ../../pep-0486.txt:112
msgid ""
"The PEP makes no attempt to promote the use of the launcher for running "
"Python on Windows.  Most existing documentation assumes the user of "
"``python`` as the command to run Python, and (for example) ``pip`` to run"
" an installed Python command.  This documentation is not expected to "
"change, and users who choose to manage their ``PATH`` environment "
"variable can continue to use this form.  The focus of this PEP is purely "
"on allowing users who prefer to use the launcher when dealing with their "
"system Python installations, to be able to continue to do so when using "
"virtual environments."

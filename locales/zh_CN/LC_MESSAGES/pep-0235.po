"This is essentially a retroactive PEP: the issue came up too late in the "
"2.1 release process to solicit wide opinion before deciding what to do, "
"and can't be put off until 2.2 without also delaying the Cygwin and MacOS"
" X ports."

msgid ""
"File systems vary across platforms in whether or not they preserve the "
"case of filenames, and in whether or not the platform C library file-"
"opening functions do or don't insist on case-sensitive matches::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:41

"In the upper left box, if you create \"fiLe\" it's stored as \"fiLe\", "
"and only ``open(\"fiLe\")`` will open it (``open(\"file\")`` will not, "
"nor will the 14 other variations on that theme)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:45
msgid ""
"In the lower right box, if you create \"fiLe\", there's no telling what "
"it's stored as -- but most likely as \"FILE\" -- and any of the 16 "
"obvious variations on ``open(\"FilE\")`` will open it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:49
msgid ""
"The lower left box is a mix: creating \"fiLe\" stores \"fiLe\" in the "
"platform directory, but you don't have to match case when opening it; any"
" of the 16 obvious variations on ``open(\"FILe\")`` work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:53
msgid ""
"NONE OF THAT IS CHANGING!  Python will continue to follow platform "
"conventions w.r.t. whether case is preserved when creating a file, and "
"w.r.t. whether ``open()`` requires a case-sensitive match.  In practice, "
"you should always code as if matches were case-sensitive, else your "
"program won't be portable."

"Support for MacOSX HFS+, and for Cygwin, is new in 2.1, so nothing is "
"changing there.  What's changing is Windows behavior.  Here are the "
"current rules for import on Windows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:70
msgid ""
"Despite that the filesystem is case-insensitive, Python insists on a "
"case-sensitive match.  But not in the way the upper left box works: if "
"you have two files, ``FiLe.py`` and ``file.py`` on ``sys.path``, and do "
"::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:77
msgid ""
"then if Python finds ``FiLe.py`` first, it raises a ``NameError``. It "
"does *not* go on to find ``file.py``; indeed, it's impossible to import "
"any but the first case-insensitive match on ``sys.path``, and then only "
"if case matches exactly in the first case-insensitive match."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:83
msgid ""
"An ugly exception: if the first case-insensitive match on ``sys.path`` is"
" for a file whose name is entirely in upper case (``FILE.PY`` or "
"``FILE.PYC`` or ``FILE.PYO``), then the import silently grabs that, no "
"matter what mixture of case was used in the import statement.  This is "
"apparently to cater to miserable old filesystems that really fit in the "
"lower right box.  But this exception is unique to Windows, for reasons "
"that may or may not exist."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:92
msgid ""
"And another exception: if the environment variable ``PYTHONCASEOK`` "
"exists, Python silently grabs the first case-insensitive match of any "
"kind."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:96
msgid ""
"So these Windows rules are pretty complicated, and neither match the Unix"
" rules nor provide semantics natural for the native filesystem.  That "
"makes them hard to explain to Unix *or* Windows users.  Nevertheless, "
"they've worked fine for years, and in isolation there's no compelling "
"reason to change them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0235.txt:102
msgid ""
"However, that was before the MacOSX HFS+ and Cygwin ports arrived. They "
"also have case-preserving case-insensitive filesystems, but the people "
"doing the ports despised the Windows rules.  Indeed, a patch to make HFS+"
" act like Unix for imports got past a reviewer and into the code base, "
"which incidentally made Cygwin also act like Unix (but this met the "
"unbounded approval of the Cygwin folks, so they sure didn't complain -- "
"they had patches of their own pending to do this, but the reviewer for "
"those balked)."

"#B is the same rule as is used on Unix, so this will improve cross- "

"Cygwin folks want (and wanted enough to implement themselves, multiple "
"times, which is a powerful argument in PythonLand).  It can't cause any "
"existing non-exceptional Windows import to fail, because any existing "
"non-exceptional Windows import finds a case-sensitive match first in the "
"path -- and it still will.  An exceptional Windows import currently blows"
" up with a ``NameError`` or ``ImportError``, in which latter case it "
"still will, or in which former case will continue searching, and either "
"succeed or blow up with an ``ImportError``."

" support) ``PYTHONCASEOK`` for their benefit, but they don't deserve "
"multiple hacks in 2001."

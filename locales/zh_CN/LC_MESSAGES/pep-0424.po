"CPython currently defines a ``__length_hint__`` method on several types, "
"such as various iterators.  This method is then used by various other "
"functions (such as ``list``) to presize lists based on the estimate "
"returned by ``__length_hint__``.  Types which are not sized, and thus "
"should not define ``__len__``, can then define ``__length_hint__``, to "
"allow estimating or computing a size (such as many iterators)."

msgid ""
"``__length_hint__`` must return an integer (else a ``TypeError`` is "
"raised) or ``NotImplemented``, and is not required to be accurate.  It "
"may return a value that is either larger or smaller than the actual size "
"of the container.  A return value of ``NotImplemented`` indicates that "
"there is no finite length estimate.  It may not return a negative value "
"(else a ValueError is raised)."

"In addition, a new function ``operator.length_hint`` hint is added, with "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0424.txt:75
msgid ""
"Being able to pre-allocate lists based on the expected size, as estimated"
" by ``__length_hint__``, can be a significant optimization. CPython has "
"been observed to run some code faster than PyPy, purely because of this "
"optimization being present."

"After this PEP was initially drafted, PEP 508 was developed and submitted"
" to fully specify the dependency declaration syntax, including "
"environment markers. As a result, this PEP ended up being rejected in "
"favour of the more comprehensive PEP 508."

msgid ""
"An **environment marker** describes a condition about the current "
"execution environment. They are used to indicate when certain "
"dependencies are only required in particular environments, and to "
"indicate supported platforms for distributions with additional "
"constraints beyond the availability of a Python runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0496.txt:29
msgid ""
"Environment markers were first specified in PEP-0345 [#pep345]_. PEP-0426"
" [#pep426]_ (which would replace PEP-0345) proposed extensions to the "
"markers. When 2.7.10 was released, even these extensions became "
"insufficient due to their reliance on simple lexical comparisons, and "
"thus this PEP has been born."

#: ../../pep-0496.txt:37
msgid "Many Python packages are written with portability in mind."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0496.txt:39
msgid ""
"For many packages this means they aim to support a wide range of Python "
"releases. If they depend on libraries such as ``argparse`` - which "
"started as external libraries, but later got incorporated into core - "
"specifying a single set of requirements is difficult, as the set of "
"required packages differs depending on the version of Python in use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0496.txt:46
msgid ""
"For other packages, designing for portability means supporting multiple "
"operating systems. However, the significant differences between them may "
"mean that particular dependencies are only needed on particular platforms"
" (relying on ``pywin32`` only on Windows, for example)\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0496.txt:52

"Environment Markers attempt to provide more flexibility in a list of "
"requirements by allowing the developer to list requirements that are "
"specific to a particular environment."

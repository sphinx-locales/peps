"This PEP proposes adding % formatting operations similar to Python 2's "
"``str`` type to ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` [1]_ [2]_."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:26
msgid ""
"While interpolation is usually thought of as a string operation, there "
"are cases where interpolation on ``bytes`` or ``bytearrays`` make sense, "
"and the work needed to make up for this missing functionality detracts "
"from the overall readability of the code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:33
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:35
msgid ""
"With Python 3 and the split between ``str`` and ``bytes``, one small but "
"important area of programming became slightly more difficult, and much "
"more painful -- wire format protocols [3]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:39
#, python-format
msgid ""
"This area of programming is characterized by a mixture of binary data and"
" ASCII compatible segments of text (aka ASCII-encoded text).  Bringing "
"back a restricted %-interpolation for ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` will "
"aid both in writing new wire format code, and in porting Python 2 wire "
"format code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:44
msgid ""
"Common use-cases include ``dbf`` and ``pdf`` file formats, ``email`` "
"formats, and ``FTP`` and ``HTTP`` communications, among many others."

"All the numeric formatting codes (``d``, ``i``, ``o``, ``u``, ``x``, "
"``X``, ``e``, ``E``, ``f``, ``F``, ``g``, ``G``, and any that are "
"subsequently added to Python 3) will be supported, and will work as they "
"do for str, including the padding, justification and other related "
"modifiers (currently ``#``, ``0``, ``-``, `` `` (space), and ``+`` (plus "
"any added to Python 3)).  The only non-numeric codes allowed are ``c``, "
"``b``, ``a``, and ``s`` (which is a synonym for b)."

#, python-format

"For the numeric codes, the only difference between ``str`` and ``bytes`` "
"(or ``bytearray``) interpolation is that the results from these codes "

"As noted above, ``%s`` and ``%r`` are being included solely to help ease "

"Originally this PEP also proposed adding format-style formatting, but it "
"was decided that format and its related machinery were all strictly text "

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:194
msgid ""
"Various new special methods were proposed, such as ``__ascii__``, "
"``__format_bytes__``, etc.; such methods are not needed at this time, but"

"assumptions about encodings"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:210

"offering %-interpolation that assumes an ASCII encoding will be an "
"attractive nuisance and lead us back to the problems of the Python 2 "
"``str``/``unicode`` text model"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:214
msgid ""
"As was seen during the discussion, ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` are also "
"used for mixed binary data and ASCII-compatible segments: file formats "
"such as ``dbf`` and ``pdf``, network protocols such as ``ftp`` and "
"``email``, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:218
#, python-format
msgid ""
"``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` already have several methods which assume an "
"ASCII compatible encoding.  ``upper()``, ``isalpha()``, and "
"``expandtabs()`` to name just a few.  %-interpolation, with its very "
"restricted mini-language, will not be any more of a nuisance than the "
"already existing methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0461.txt:223

"Some have objected to allowing the full range of numeric formatting codes"
" with the claim that decimal alone would be sufficient.  However, at "

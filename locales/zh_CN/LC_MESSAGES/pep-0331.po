"Support for the ``LC_NUMERIC`` locale category in Python 2.3 is "
"implemented only in Python-space.  This causes inconsistent behavior and "
"thread-safety issues for applications that use extension modules and "
"libraries implemented in C that parse and generate floats from strings.  "
"This document proposes a plan for removing this inconsistency by "
"providing and using substitute locale-agnostic functions as necessary."

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:29
msgid ""
"Python provides generic localization services through the locale module, "
"which among other things allows localizing the display and conversion "
"process of numeric types.  Locale categories, such as ``LC_TIME`` and "
"``LC_COLLATE``, allow configuring precisely what aspects of the "
"application are to be localized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:35
msgid ""
"The ``LC_NUMERIC`` category specifies formatting for non-monetary numeric"
" information, such as the decimal separator in float and fixed-precision "
"numbers.  Localization of the ``LC_NUMERIC`` category is currently "
"implemented only in Python-space; C libraries invoked from the Python "
"runtime are unaware of Python's ``LC_NUMERIC`` setting.  This is done to "
"avoid changing the behavior of certain low-level functions that are used "
"by the Python parser and related code [2]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:44
msgid ""
"However, this presents a problem for extension modules that wrap C "
"libraries.  Applications that use these extension modules will "
"inconsistently display and convert floating-point values."

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:48
msgid ""
"James Henstridge, the author of PyGTK [3]_, has additionally pointed out "
"that the ``setlocale()`` function also presents thread-safety issues, "
"since a thread may call the C library ``setlocale()`` outside of the GIL,"
" and cause Python to parse and generate floats incorrectly."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:58
msgid ""
"The inconsistency between Python and C library localization for "
"``LC_NUMERIC`` is a problem for any localized application using C "
"extensions.  The exact nature of the problem will vary depending on the "
"application, but it will most likely occur when parsing or formatting a "
"floating-point value."

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:66
msgid "Example Problem"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:68
msgid ""
"The initial problem that motivated this PEP is related to the "
"GtkSpinButton [4]_ widget in the GTK+ UI toolkit, wrapped by the PyGTK "
"module.  The widget can be set to numeric mode, and when this occurs, "
"characters typed into it are evaluated as a number."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0331.txt:73
msgid ""
"Problems occur when ``LC_NUMERIC`` is set to a locale with a float "
"separator that differs from the C locale's standard (for instance, ',' "
"instead of '.' for the Brazilian locale pt_BR).  Because ``LC_NUMERIC`` "
"is not set at the libc level, float values are displayed incorrectly "
"(using '.' as a separator) in the spinbutton's text entry, and it is "
"impossible to enter fractional values using the ',' separator."

"This problem was initially reported as a problem in the GTK+ libraries "
"[5]_; since then it has been correctly diagnosed as an inconsistency in "
"Python's implementation.  However, in a fortunate coincidence, the glib "
"library (developed primarily for GTK+, not to be confused with the GNU C "
"library) implements a number of ``LC_NUMERIC``-agnostic functions (for an"
" example, see [6]_) for reasons similar to those presented in this paper."

"In the same GTK+ problem report, Havoc Pennington suggested that the glib"

"This PEP describes the 'lockstep iteration' proposal.  This PEP tracks "
"the status and ownership of this feature, slated for introduction in "
"Python 2.0.  It contains a description of the feature and outlines "
"changes necessary to support the feature. This PEP summarizes discussions"
" held in mailing list forums, and provides URLs for further information, "
"where appropriate.  The CVS revision history of this file contains the "
"definitive historical record."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:30
msgid ""
"Standard for-loops in Python iterate over every element in a sequence "
"until the sequence is exhausted [1]_.  However, for-loops iterate over "
"only a single sequence, and it is often desirable to loop over more than "
"one sequence in a lock-step fashion.  In other words, in a way such that "
"the i-th iteration through the loop returns an object containing the i-th"
" element from each sequence."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:37
msgid ""
"The common idioms used to accomplish this are unintuitive.  This PEP "
"proposes a standard way of performing such iterations by introducing a "
"new builtin function called ``zip``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:41
msgid ""
"While the primary motivation for zip() comes from lock-step iteration, by"
" implementing zip() as a built-in function, it has additional utility in "
"contexts other than for-loops."

msgid "Lockstep For-Loops"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:48
msgid ""
"Lockstep for-loops are non-nested iterations over two or more sequences, "
"such that at each pass through the loop, one element from each sequence "
"is taken to compose the target.  This behavior can already be "
"accomplished in Python through the use of the map() built- in function::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:64
msgid "The for-loop simply iterates over this list as normal."

"While the map() idiom is a common one in Python, it has several "
"disadvantages:"

"It has arbitrary, often unintended, and inflexible semantics when the "
"lists are not of the same length: the shorter sequences are padded with "
"``None``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For these reasons, several proposals were floated in the Python 2.0 beta "
"time frame for syntactic support of lockstep for-loops. Here are two "
"suggestions::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:94
msgid ""
"Neither of these forms would work, since they both already mean something"
" in Python and changing the meanings would break existing code.  All "
"other suggestions for new syntax suffered the same problem, or were in "
"conflict with other another proposed feature called 'list comprehensions'"
" (see PEP 202)."

msgid ""
"The proposed solution is to introduce a new built-in sequence generator "
"function, available in the ``__builtin__`` module.  This function is to "
"be called ``zip`` and has the following signature::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:109
msgid ""
"``zip()`` takes one or more sequences and weaves their elements together,"
" just as ``map(None, ...)`` does with sequences of equal length.  The "
"weaving stops when the shortest sequence is exhausted."

"The function's name.  An earlier version of this PEP included an open "
"issue listing 20+ proposed alternative names to ``zip()``.  In the face "
"of no overwhelmingly better choice, the BDFL strongly prefers ``zip()`` "
"due to its Haskell [2]_ heritage.  See version 1.7 of this PEP for the "
"list of alternatives."

"Optional padding.  An earlier version of this PEP proposed an optional "
"``pad`` keyword argument, which would be used when the argument sequences"
" were not the same length.  This is similar behavior to the ``map(None, "
"...)`` semantics except that the user would be able to specify pad "
"object.  This has been rejected by the BDFL in favor of always truncating"
" to the shortest sequence, because of the KISS principle.  If there's a "
"true need, it is easier to add later.  If it is not needed, it would "
"still be impossible to delete it in the future."

"Lazy evaluation.  An earlier version of this PEP proposed that ``zip()`` "
"return a built-in object that performed lazy evaluation using "
"``__getitem__()`` protocol.  This has been strongly rejected by the BDFL "
"in favor of returning a real Python list.  If lazy evaluation is desired "
"in the future, the BDFL suggests an ``xzip()`` function be added."

"Inner and outer container control.  An earlier version of this PEP "
"contains a rather lengthy discussion on a feature that some people "
"wanted, namely the ability to control what the inner and outer container "
"types were (they are tuples and list respectively in this version of the "
"PEP).  Given the simplified API and implementation, this elaboration is "
"rejected.  For a more detailed analysis, see version 1.7 of this PEP."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:232
msgid ""
"In Python 2.4, zip() with no arguments was modified to return an empty "
"list rather than raising a TypeError exception.  The rationale for the "
"original behavior was that the absence of arguments was thought to "
"indicate a programming error.  However, that thinking did not anticipate "
"the use of zip() with the ``*`` operator for unpacking variable length "
"argument lists.  For example, the inverse of zip could be defined as:  "
"``unzip = lambda s: zip(*s)``.  That transformation also defines a matrix"
" transpose or an equivalent row/column swap for tables defined as lists "
"of tuples.  The latter transformation is commonly used when reading data "
"files with records as rows and fields as columns.  For example, the "
"code::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:246
msgid ""
"rearranges columnar data so that each field is collected into individual "
"tuples for straightforward looping and summarization::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:251
msgid ""
"Using ``zip(*args)`` is more easily coded if ``zip(*[])`` is handled as "
"an allowable case rather than an exception.  This is especially helpful "
"when data is either built up from or recursed down to a null case with no"
" records."
msgstr ""

"Seeing this possibility, the BDFL agreed (with some misgivings) to have "
"the behavior changed for Py2.4."

"The ``xzip()`` function discussed above was implemented in Py2.3 in the "
"``itertools`` module as ``itertools.izip()``.  This function provides "
"lazy behavior, consuming single elements and producing a single tuple on "
"each pass.  The \"just-in-time\" style saves memory and runs faster than "
"its list based counterpart, ``zip()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0201.txt:268
msgid ""
"The ``itertools`` module also added ``itertools.repeat()`` and "
"``itertools.chain()``.  These tools can be used together to pad sequences"

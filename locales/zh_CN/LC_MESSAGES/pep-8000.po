"Surveys will be conducted of governance models for similar open source "

"how such projects can be successfully governed, and may serve as "
"inspiration for Python's own governance model.  Python is unique, so it's"
" expected that it will have its own spin on governance, rather than "
"directly adopting any of those surveyed."

"splitting individual PEPs."

"This PEP proposes a model of Python governance based around a steering "
"council. The council has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as "
"rarely as possible; instead, they use this power to establish standard "
"processes, like those proposed in the other 801x-series PEPs.  This "
"follows the general philosophy that it's better to split up large changes"
" into a series of small changes that can be reviewed independently: "
"instead of trying to do everything in one PEP, we focus on providing a "
"minimal-but-solid foundation for further governance decisions."

"This PEP outlines the python-dev voting guidelines.  These guidelines "
"serve to provide feedback or gauge the \"wind direction\" on a particular"
" proposal, idea, or feature.  They don't have a binding force."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0010.txt:26
msgid ""
"When a new idea, feature, patch, etc. is floated in the Python community,"
" either through a PEP or on the mailing lists (most likely on python-dev "
"[1]_), it is sometimes helpful to gauge the community's general "
"sentiment.  Sometimes people just want to register their opinion of an "
"idea.  Sometimes the BDFL wants to take a straw poll. Whatever the "
"reason, these guidelines have been adopted so as to provide a common "
"language for developers."

"While opinions are (sometimes) useful, but they are never binding. "
"Opinions that are accompanied by rationales are always valued higher than"
" bare scores (this is especially true with -1 votes)."

"The scoring guidelines are loosely derived from the Apache voting "
"procedure [2]_, with of course our own spin on things.  There are 4 "

"You may occasionally see wild flashes of enthusiasm (either for or "
"against) with vote scores like +2, +1000, or -1000.  These aren't really "
"valued much beyond the above scores, but it's nice to see people get "
"excited about such geeky stuff."

"The Python source code is currently managed in a CVS repository on "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:25

"This change has two aspects: moving from CVS to Subversion, and moving "

msgid "Moving to Subversion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:32
msgid ""
"CVS has a number of limitations that have been eliminated by Subversion."
"  For the development of Python, the most notable improvements are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:36
msgid ""
"the ability to rename files and directories, and to remove directories, "
"while keeping the history of these files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:39
msgid ""
"support for change sets (sets of correlated changes to multiple files) "
"through global revision numbers.  Change sets are transactional."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:43
msgid ""
"atomic, fast tagging: a cvs tag might take many minutes; a Subversion tag"
" (svn cp) will complete quickly, and atomically. Likewise, branches are "
"very efficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:47
msgid "support for offline diffs, which is useful when creating patches."

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:53
msgid ""
"SourceForge has kindly provided an important infrastructure for the past "
"years.  Unfortunately, the attention that SF received has also caused "
"repeated overload situations in the past, to which the SF operators could"
" not always respond in a timely manner.  In particular, for CVS, they had"
" to reduce the load on the primary CVS server by introducing a second, "
"read-only CVS server for anonymous access.  This server is regularly "
"synchronized, but lags behind the read-write CVS repository between "
"synchronizations.  As a result, users without commit access can see "
"recent changes to the repository only after a delay."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:64
msgid ""
"On python.org, it would be possible to make the repository accessible for"

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:71

"To move the Python CVS repository, the following steps need to be "

msgid "Collect SSH keys"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:93
msgid ""
"After some discussion, svn+ssh was selected as the best method for write "
"access to the repository. Developers can continue to use their SSH keys, "
"but they must be installed on python.org."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:97
msgid ""
"In order to avoid having to create a new Unix user for each developer, a "
"single account should be used, with command= attributes in the "
"authorized_keys files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:101
msgid ""
"The lines in the authorized_keys file should read like this (wrapped for "
"better readability)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:109
msgid ""
"As the usernames, the real names should be used instead of the SF account"
" names, so that people can be better identified in log messages."

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:114
msgid "Administrator Access"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:116
msgid ""
"Administrator access to the pythondev account should be granted to all "
"current admins of the Python SF project. To distinguish between shell "
"login and svnserve login, admins need to maintain two keys. Using "
"OpenSSH, the following procedure can be used to create a second key::"

msgid "Converting the CVS Repository"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:154
msgid ""
"The Python CVS repository contains two modules: distutils and python. The"
" python module is further structured into dist and nondist, where dist "
"only contains src (the python code proper). nondist contains various "
"subdirectories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:159
msgid ""
"These should be reorganized in the Subversion repository to get shorter "
"URLs, following the <project>/{trunk,tags,branches} structure.  A project"
" will be created for each nondist directory, plus for src (called "
"python), plus distutils.  Reorganizing the repository is best done in the"
" CVS tree, as shown below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:165
msgid ""
"The fsfs backend should be used as the repository format (which requires "
"Subversion 1.1).  The fsfs backend has the advantage of being more "
"backup-friendly, as it allows incremental repository backups, without "
"requiring any dump commands to be run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:170
msgid ""
"The conversion should be done using the cvs2svn utility, available e.g. "
"in the cvs2svn Debian package.  As cvs2svn does not currently support the"
" project/trunk structure, each project needs to be converted separately."
"  To get each conversion result into a separate directory in the target "
"repository, svnadmin load must be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:176
msgid ""
"Subversion has a different view on binary-vs-text files than CVS. To "
"correctly carry the CVS semantics forward, svn:eol-style should be set to"
" native on all files that are not marked binary in the CVS."

msgid ""
"The repository should be published at http://svn.python.org/projects. "
"Read-write access should be granted to all current SF committers through "
"svn+ssh://pythondev@svn.python.org/; read-only anonymous access through "
"WebDAV should also be granted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:220
msgid ""
"As an option, websvn (available e.g. from the Debian websvn package) "
"could be provided. Unfortunately, in the test installation, websvn breaks"
" because it runs out of memory."

msgid "Disable CVS"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:231
msgid ""
"It appears that CVS cannot be disabled entirely.  Only the user interface"
" can be removed from the project page; the repository itself remains "
"available.  If desired, write access to the python and distutils modules "
"can be disabled through a CVS commitinfo entry."

msgid ""
"Several alternatives had been suggested to the procedure above. The "
"rejected alternatives are shortly discussed here:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:243
msgid ""
"create multiple repositories, one for python and one for distutils. This "
"would have allowed even shorter URLs, but was rejected because a single "
"repository supports moving code across projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:248
msgid ""
"Several people suggested to create the project/trunk structure through "
"standard cvs2svn, followed by renames. This would have the disadvantage "
"that old revisions use different path names than recent revisions; the "
"suggested approach through dump files works without renames."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:254
msgid ""
"Several people also expressed concern about the administrative overhead "
"that hosting the repository on python.org would cause to pydotorg admins."
"  As a specific alternative, BerliOS has been suggested.  The pydotorg "
"admins themselves haven\\'t objected to the additional workload; "
"migrating the repository again if they get overworked is an option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:261
msgid ""
"Different authentication strategies were discussed. As alternatives to "
"svn+ssh were suggested"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:264
msgid ""
"Subversion over WebDAV, using SSL and basic authentication, with "
"pydotorg-generated passwords mailed to the user. People did not like that"
" approach, since they would need to store the password on disk (because "
"they can't remember it); this is a security risk."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:270
msgid ""
"Subversion over WebDAV, using SSL client certificates. This would work, "
"but would require us to administer a certificate authority."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0347.txt:273
msgid ""
"Instead of hosting this on python.org, people suggested hosting it "
"elsewhere. One issue is whether this alternative should be free or "
"commercial; several people suggested it should better be commercial, to "
"reduce the load on the volunteers. In particular:"
msgstr ""

"Greg Stein suggested http://www.wush.net/subversion.php. They offer 5 GB "
"for $90/month, with 200 GB download/month. The data is on a RAID drive "
"and fully backed up. Anonymous access and email commit notifications are "
"supported. wush.net elaborated the following details:"

"They have a Web interface for management of the various SVN repositories "

"Bob Ippolito reported that they had used wush.net for a commercial "
"project for about 6 months, after which time they left wush.net, because "

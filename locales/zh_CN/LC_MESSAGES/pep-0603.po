"A *persistent data structure* is defined as a data structure that "
"preserves the previous version of the data when the data is modified. "
"Such data structures are effectively *immutable*, as operations on them "
"do not update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new "
"updated structure (see [0]_ for more details.)"

"This PEP proposes to add a new fully persistent and immutable mapping "
"type called ``frozenmap`` to the ``collections`` module."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:33
msgid ""
"Python has two immutable collection types: ``tuple`` and ``frozenset``.  "
"These types can be used to represent immutable lists and sets. However, a"
" way to represent immutable *mappings* does not yet exist, and this PEP "
"proposes a ``frozenmap`` to implement an immutable *mapping*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:39
msgid "The proposed ``frozenmap`` type:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:41
msgid "implements the ``collections.abc.Mapping`` protocol,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:42
msgid "supports pickling, and"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:43
msgid "provides an API for efficient creation of \"modified\" versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:45
msgid "The following use cases illustrate why an immutable mapping is desirable:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:48
msgid ""
"Immutable mappings are hashable which allows their use as dictionary keys"
" or set elements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:51
msgid ""
"This hashable property permits functions decorated with "
"``@functools.lru_cache()`` to accept immutable mappings as arguments. "
"Unlike an immutable mapping, passing a plain ``dict`` to such a function "
"results in error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:56
msgid ""
"Immutable mappings can hold complex state. Since immutable mappings can "
"be copied by reference, transactional mutation of state can be "
"efficiently implemented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:60
msgid ""
"Immutable mappings can be used to safely share dictionaries across thread"
" and asynchronous task boundaries. The immutability makes it easier to "
"reason about threads and asynchronous tasks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0603.rst:64
msgid ""
"Lastly, CPython [1]_ already contains the main portion of the C code "
"required for the ``frozenmap`` implementation.  The C code already exists"
" to implement the ``contextvars`` module (see :pep:`567` for more "
"details.) Exposing this C code via a public collection type drastically "
"increases the number of users of the code.  This leads to increased code "
"quality by discovering bugs and improving performance which without a "
"``frozenmap`` collection would be very challenging because most programs "
"use the ``contextvars`` module indirectly."

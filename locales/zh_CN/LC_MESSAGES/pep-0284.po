"This PEP is rejected.  There were a number of fixable issues with the "
"proposal (see the fixups listed in Raymond Hettinger's python-dev post on"
" 18 June 2005 [5]_).  However, even with the fixups the proposal did not "
"garner support.  Specifically, Guido did not buy the premise that the "
"``range()`` format needed fixing, \"The whole point (15 years ago) of "
"``range()`` was to *avoid* needing syntax to specify a loop over numbers."
" I think it's worked out well and there's nothing that needs to be fixed "
"(except ``range()`` needs to become an iterator, which it will in Python "
"3.0).\""

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:50
msgid ""
"One of the most common uses of for-loops in Python is to iterate over an "
"interval of integers.  Python provides functions ``range()`` and "
"``xrange()`` to generate lists and iterators for such intervals, which "
"work best for the most frequent case: half-open intervals increasing from"
" zero.  However, the ``range()`` syntax is more awkward for open or "
"closed intervals, and lacks symmetry when reversing the order of "
"iteration.  In addition, the call to an unfamiliar function makes it "
"difficult for newcomers to Python to understand code that uses "
"``range()`` or ``xrange()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:60
msgid ""
"The perceived lack of a natural, intuitive integer iteration syntax has "
"led to heated debate on python-list, and spawned at least four PEPs "
"before this one.  PEP 204 [1]_ (rejected) proposed to re-use Python's "
"slice syntax for integer ranges, leading to a terser syntax but not "
"solving the readability problem of multi-argument ``range()``.  PEP 212 "
"[2]_ (deferred) proposed several syntaxes for directly converting a list "
"to a sequence of integer indices, in place of the current idiom ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:71
msgid ""
"for such conversion, and PEP 281 [3]_ proposes to simplify the same idiom"
" by allowing it to be written as ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:76
msgid ""
"PEP 276 [4]_ proposes to allow automatic conversion of integers to "
"iterators, simplifying the most common half-open case but not addressing "
"the complexities of other types of interval. Additional alternatives have"
" been discussed on python-list."

"The solution described here is to allow a three-way comparison after a "
"\"for\" keyword, both in the context of a for-loop and of a list "
"comprehension::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:87
msgid ""
"This would cause iteration over an interval of consecutive integers, "
"beginning at the left bound in the comparison and ending at the right "
"bound.  The exact comparison operations used would determine whether the "
"interval is open or closed at either end and whether the integers are "
"considered in ascending or descending order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:94
msgid ""
"This syntax closely matches standard mathematical notation, so is likely "
"to be more familiar to Python novices than the current ``range()`` "
"syntax.  Open and closed interval endpoints are equally easy to express, "
"and the reversal of an integer interval can be formed simply by swapping "
"the two endpoints and reversing the comparisons.  In addition, the "
"semantics of such a loop would closely resemble one way of interpreting "
"the existing Python for-loops::"

"In all cases the expression formed by for_test would be subject to the "

"We refer to the two or_expr's occurring on the left and right sides of "

"executed, the expressions for both bounds will be evaluated, and an "
"iterator object created that iterates through all integers between the "
"two bounds according to the comparison operations used.  The iterator "
"will begin with an integer equal or near to the left bound, and then step"
" through the remaining integers with a step size of +1 or -1 if the "
"comparison operation is in the set described by less_comp or greater_comp"

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:185
msgid ""
"Should the right bound be evaluated once, or every time through the loop?"
"  Clearly, it only makes sense to evaluate the left bound once.  For "
"reasons of consistency and efficiency, we have chosen the same convention"
" for the right bound."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:190
msgid ""
"Although the new syntax considerably simplifies integer for-loops, list "
"comprehensions using the new syntax are not as simple.  We feel that this"
" is appropriate since for-loops are more frequent than comprehensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:195
msgid ""
"The proposal does not allow access to integer iterator objects such as "
"would be created by ``xrange``.  True, but we see this as a shortcoming "
"in the general list-comprehension syntax, beyond the scope of this "
"proposal.  In addition, ``xrange()`` will still be available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:201
msgid ""
"The proposal does not allow increments other than 1 and -1. More general "
"arithmetic progressions would need to be created by ``range()`` or "

"syntax, leading to a possible loss of readability.  We feel that this "
"loss is outweighed by the increase in readability from a natural integer "
"iteration syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:216
msgid ""
"To some extent, this PEP addresses the same issues as PEP 276 [4]_.  We "
"feel that the two PEPs are not in conflict since PEP 276 is primarily "
"concerned with half-open ranges starting in 0 (the easy case of "
"``range()``) while this PEP is primarily concerned with simplifying all "
"other cases.  However, if this PEP is approved, its new simpler syntax "
"for integer loops could to some extent reduce the motivation for PEP 276."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:224
msgid ""
"It is not clear whether it makes sense to allow floating point bounds for"
" an integer loop: if a float represents an inexact value, how can it be "
"used to determine an exact sequence of integers?  On the other hand, "
"disallowing float bounds would make it difficult to use ``floor()`` and "
"``ceiling()`` in integer for-loops, as it is difficult to use them now "
"with ``range()``.  We have erred on the side of flexibility, but this may"
" lead to some implementation difficulties in determining the smallest and"
" largest integer values that would cause a given comparison to be true."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0284.txt:235
msgid ""
"Should types other than int, long, and float be allowed as bounds?  "
"Another choice would be to convert all bounds to integers by ``int()``, "
"and allow as bounds anything that can be so converted instead of just "
"floats.  However, this would change the semantics: ``0.3 <= x`` is not "
"the same as ``int(0.3) <= x``, and it would be confusing for a loop with "
"0.3 as lower bound to start at zero.  Also, in general ``int(f)`` can be "
"very far from ``f``."

msgid ""
"An implementation is not available at this time.  Implementation is not "
"expected to pose any great difficulties: the new syntax could, if "
"necessary, be recognized by parsing a general expression after each "
"\"for\" keyword and testing whether the top level operation of the "
"expression is \"in\" or a three-way comparison. The Python compiler would"
" convert any instance of the new syntax into a loop over the items in a "
"special iterator object."

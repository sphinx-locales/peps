#: ../../pep-0535.txt:23
msgid ""
"Inspired by PEP 335, and building on the circuit breaking protocol "
"described in PEP 532, this PEP proposes a change to the definition of "
"chained comparisons, where the comparison chaining will be updated to use"
" the left-associative circuit breaking operator (``else``) rather than "
"the logical disjunction operator  (``and``) if the left hand comparison "
"returns a circuit breaker as its result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:30
msgid ""
"While there are some practical complexities arising from the current "
"handling of single-valued arrays in NumPy, this change should be "
"sufficient to allow elementwise chained comparison operations for "
"matrices, where the result is a matrix of boolean values, rather than "
"raising ``ValueError`` or tautologically returning ``True`` (indicating a"
" non-empty matrix)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:38
msgid "Relationship with other PEPs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:40
msgid ""
"This PEP has been extracted from earlier iterations of PEP 532, as a "
"follow-on use case for the circuit breaking protocol, rather than an "
"essential part of its introduction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:44
msgid ""
"The specific proposal in this PEP to handle the element-wise comparison "
"use case by changing the semantic definition of comparison chaining is "
"drawn directly from Guido's rejection of PEP 335."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:50
msgid "Specification"

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:52
msgid "A chained comparison like ``0 < x < 10`` written as::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:56
msgid "is currently roughly semantically equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:62
msgid ""
"Using the circuit breaking concepts introduced in PEP 532, this PEP "
"proposes that comparison chaining be changed to explicitly check if the "
"left comparison returns a circuit breaker, and if so, use ``else`` rather"
" than ``and`` to implement the comparison chaining::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:74
msgid ""
"This allows types like NumPy arrays to control the behaviour of chained "
"comparisons by returning suitably defined circuit breakers from "
"comparison operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:78
msgid ""
"The expansion of this logic to an arbitrary number of chained comparison "
"operations would be the same as the existing expansion for ``and``."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:84
msgid "In ultimately rejecting PEP 335, Guido van Rossum noted [1_]:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:86
msgid ""
"The NumPy folks brought up a somewhat separate issue: for them, the most "
"common use case is chained comparisons (e.g. A < B < C)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:89
msgid ""
"To understand this observation, we first need to look at how comparisons "
"work with NumPy arrays::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:102
msgid ""
"Here we see that NumPy array comparisons are element-wise by default, "
"comparing each element in the left hand array to the corresponding "
"element in the right hand array, and producing a matrix of boolean "
"results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:106
msgid ""
"If either side of the comparison is a scalar value, then it is broadcast "
"across the array and compared to each individual element::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:114
msgid ""
"However, this broadcasting idiom breaks down if we attempt to use chained"
" comparisons::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:122
msgid ""
"The problem is that internally, Python implicitly expands this chained "
"comparison into the form::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:130
msgid ""
"And NumPy only permits implicit coercion to a boolean value for single-"
"element arrays where ``a.any()`` and ``a.all()`` can be assured of having"
" the same result::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:143
msgid ""
"The proposal in this PEP would allow this situation to be changed by "
"updating the definition of element-wise comparison operations in NumPy to"
" return a dedicated subclass that implements the new circuit breaking "
"protocol and also changes the result array's interpretation in a boolean "
"context to always return ``False`` and hence never trigger the short-"
"circuiting behaviour::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0535.txt:164
msgid ""
"With this change, the chained comparison example above would be able to "
"return::"

#: ../../pep-0420.txt:97
msgid ""
"The current imperative approach to namespace packages has led to multiple"
" slightly-incompatible mechanisms for providing namespace packages.  For "
"example, pkgutil supports ``*.pkg`` files; setuptools doesn't.  Likewise,"
" setuptools supports inspecting zip files, and supports adding portions "
"to its ``_namespace_packages`` variable, whereas pkgutil doesn't."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0420.txt:104
msgid ""
"Namespace packages are designed to support being split across multiple "
"directories (and hence found via multiple ``sys.path`` entries).  In this"
" configuration, it doesn't matter if multiple portions all provide an "
"``__init__.py`` file, so long as each portion correctly initializes the "
"namespace package.  However, Linux distribution vendors (amongst others) "
"prefer to combine the separate portions and install them all into the "
"*same* file system directory.  This creates a potential for conflict, as "
"the portions are now attempting to provide the *same* file on the target "
"system - something that is not allowed by many package managers.  "
"Allowing implicit namespace packages means that the requirement to "
"provide an ``__init__.py`` file can be dropped completely, and affected "
"portions can be installed into a common directory or split across "
"multiple directories as distributions see fit."

"If the import system was restricted to only finding portions along the "

"This PEP relaxes this constraint, and leaves the setting of ``__file__`` "
"to the purview of the loader producing the module.  Loaders may opt to "
"leave ``__file__`` unset if no file system path is appropriate.  Loaders "
"may also set additional reserved attributes on the module if useful.  "

"For example, namespace packages as described in this PEP will have no "

" provide flexibility and descriptiveness in the reprs of such modules, a "
"new optional protocol is added to PEP 302 loaders.  Loaders can implement"
" a ``module_repr()`` method which takes a single argument, the module "
"object. This method should return the string to be used verbatim as the "
"repr of the module.  The rules for producing a module repr are now "

"This PEP proposes several extensions to the Distutils packaging system "
"[1]_.  These enhancements include a central package index server, tools "

"This PEP does not address issues of package dependency.  It also does not"

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0301.txt:35
msgid ""
"Python programmers have long needed a simple method of discovering "
"existing modules and systems available for their use.  It is arguable "
"that the existence of these systems for other languages have been a "
"significant contribution to their popularity.  The existence of the "
"Catalog-SIG, and the many discussions there indicate that there is a "
"large population of users who recognise this need."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0301.txt:42
msgid ""
"The introduction of the Distutils packaging system to Python simplified "
"the process of distributing shareable code, and included mechanisms for "
"the capture of package metadata, but did little with the metadata save "
"ship it with the package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0301.txt:47
msgid ""
"An interface to the index should be hosted in the python.org domain, "
"giving it an air of legitimacy that existing catalog efforts do not have."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0301.txt:51
msgid ""
"The interface for submitting information to the catalog should be as "
"simple as possible - hopefully just a one-line command for most users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0301.txt:54
msgid ""
"Issues of package dependency are not addressed due to the complexity of "
"such a system.  PEP 262 proposes such a system, but as of this writing "
"the PEP is still unfinished."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0301.txt:58
msgid ""
"Issues of package dissemination (storage on a central server) are not "
"addressed because they require assumptions about availability of storage "
"and bandwidth that I am not in a position to make.  PEP 243, which is "
"still being developed, is tackling these issues and many more.  This "
"proposal is considered compatible with, and adjunct to the proposal in "
"PEP 243."

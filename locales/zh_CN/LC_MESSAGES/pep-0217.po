"Python's interactive mode is one of the implementation's great strengths "
"-- being able to write expressions on the command line and get back a "
"meaningful output.  However, the output function cannot be all things to "
"all people, and the current output function too often falls short of this"
" goal.  This PEP describes a way to provides alternatives to the built-in"
" display function in Python, so users will have control over the output "
"from the interactive interpreter."

"The current Python solution has worked for many users, and this should "
"not break it. Therefore, in the default configuration, nothing will "
"change in the REPL loop. To change the way the interpreter prints "
"interactively entered expressions, users will have to rebind "
"``sys.displayhook`` to a callable object. The result of calling this "
"object with the result of the interactively entered expression should be "
"print-able, and this is what will be printed on ``sys.stdout``."

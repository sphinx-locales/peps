"People have to remember to uncomment bits of ``Modules/Setup`` in order "
"to get all the possible modules."

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:21
msgid ""
"Moving ``Setup`` to a new version of Python is tedious; new modules have "
"been added, so you can't just copy the older version, but have to "
"reconcile the two versions."

msgid "Use the Distutils to build the modules that come with Python."

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:34
msgid "The changes can be broken up into several pieces:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:36
msgid ""
"The Distutils needs some Python modules to be able to build modules.  "
"Currently I believe the minimal list is ``posix``, ``_sre``, and "
"``string``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:40
msgid ""
"These modules will have to be built before the Distutils can be used, so "
"they'll simply be hardwired into ``Modules/Makefile`` and be "
"automatically built."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:44
msgid ""
"A top-level setup.py script will be written that checks the libraries "
"installed on the system and compiles as many modules as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:48
msgid ""
"``Modules/Setup`` will be kept and settings in it will override "
"``setup.py``'s usual behavior, so you can disable a module known to be "
"buggy, or specify particular compilation or linker flags. However, in the"
" common case where ``setup.py`` works correctly, everything in ``Setup`` "
"will remain commented out.  The other ``Setup.*`` become unnecessary, "
"since nothing will be generating ``Setup`` automatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:56

"The patch was checked in for Python 2.1, and has been subsequently "
"modified."

msgid ""
"Patch #102588 on SourceForge contains the proposed patch. Currently the "
"patch tries to be conservative and to change as few files as possible, in"
" order to simplify backing out the patch. For example, no attempt is made"
" to rip out the existing build mechanisms.  Such simplifications can wait"
" for later in the beta cycle, when we're certain the patch will be left "
"in, or they can wait for Python 2.2."

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:73
msgid ""
"Makes some required changes to distutils/sysconfig (these will be checked"
" in separately)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:76
msgid ""
"In the top-level ``Makefile.in``, the \"sharedmods\" target simply runs "
"``\"./python setup.py build\"``, and \"sharedinstall\" runs ``\"./python "
"setup.py install\"``.  The \"clobber\" target also deletes the ``build/``"
" subdirectory where Distutils puts its output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:81
msgid ""
"``Modules/Setup.config.in`` only contains entries for the ``gc`` and "
"``thread`` modules; the ``readline``, ``curses``, and ``db`` modules are "
"removed because it's now ``setup.py``'s job to handle them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:85
msgid ""
"``Modules/Setup.dist`` now contains entries for only 3 modules -- "
"``_sre``, ``posix``, and ``strop``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:88
msgid ""
"The ``configure`` script builds ``setup.cfg`` from ``setup.cfg.in``.  "
"This is needed for two reasons: to make building in subdirectories work, "
"and to get the configured installation prefix."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:92
msgid ""
"Adds ``setup.py`` to the top directory of the source tree.  ``setup.py`` "
"is the largest piece of the puzzle, though not the most complicated.  "
"``setup.py`` contains a subclass of the ``BuildExt`` class, and extends "
"it with a ``detect_modules()`` method that does the work of figuring out "
"when modules can be compiled, and adding them to the 'exts' list."

"without manually hacking the Makefiles?  [Answer: No.]"

"The Distutils always compile modules as shared libraries.  How do we "
"support compiling them statically into the resulting Python binary?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0229.txt:110
msgid ""
"[Answer: building a Python binary with the Distutils should be feasible, "
"though no one has implemented it yet.  This should be done someday, but "
"isn't a pressing priority as messing around with the top-level "
"``Makefile.pre.in`` is good enough.]"

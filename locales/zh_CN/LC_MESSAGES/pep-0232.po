"This PEP describes an extension to Python, adding attribute dictionaries "
"to functions and methods.  This PEP tracks the status and ownership of "
"this feature.  It contains a description of the feature and outlines "
"changes necessary to support the feature. This PEP summarizes discussions"
" held in mailing list forums, and provides URLs for further information, "
"where appropriate.  The CVS revision history of this file contains the "
"definitive historical record."

msgid "Background"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:30
msgid ""
"Functions already have a number of attributes, some of which are "
"writable, e.g. ``func_doc``, a.k.a. ``func.__doc__``.  ``func_doc`` has "
"the interesting property that there is special syntax in function (and "
"method) definitions for implicitly setting the attribute.  This "
"convenience has been exploited over and over again, overloading "
"docstrings with additional semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:37
msgid ""
"For example, John Aycock has written a system where docstrings are used "
"to define parsing rules. [1]_  Zope's ZPublisher ORB [2]_ uses docstrings"
" to signal publishable methods, i.e. methods that can be called through "
"the web."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:42
msgid ""
"The problem with this approach is that the overloaded semantics may "
"conflict with each other.  For example, if we wanted to add a doctest "
"unit test to a Zope method that should not be publishable through the "
"web."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:49
msgid "Proposal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:51
msgid ""
"This proposal adds a new dictionary to function objects, called "
"``func_dict`` (a.k.a. ``__dict__``).  This dictionary can be set and get "
"using ordinary attribute set and get syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:55
msgid ""
"Methods also gain getter syntax, and they currently access the attribute "
"through the dictionary of the underlying function object.  It is not "
"possible to set attributes on bound or unbound methods, except by doing "
"so explicitly on the underlying function object.  See the `Future "
"Directions`_ discussion below for approaches in subsequent versions of "
"Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:62
msgid ""
"A function object's ``__dict__`` can also be set, but only to a "
"dictionary object.  Deleting a function's ``__dict__``, or setting it to "
"anything other than a concrete dictionary object results in a "
"``TypeError``.  If no function attributes have ever been set, the "
"function's ``__dict__`` will be empty."

msgid "Future Directions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:109
msgid ""
"Here are a number of future directions to consider.  Any adoption of "
"these ideas would require a new PEP, which referenced this one, and would"
" have to be targeted at a Python version subsequent to the 2.1 release."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:114
msgid ""
"A previous version of this PEP allowed for both setter and getter of "
"attributes on unbound methods, and only getter on bound methods.  A "
"number of problems were discovered with this policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:119
msgid ""
"Because method attributes were stored in the underlying function, this "
"caused several potentially surprising results::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:130
msgid ""
"Because a change to ``a`` bound ``c1`` also caused a change to ``a`` "
"bound to ``c2``, setting of attributes on bound methods was disallowed.  "
"However, even allowing setting of attributes on unbound methods has its "
"ambiguities::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:141
msgid ""
"For this reason, the current PEP disallows setting attributes on either "
"bound or unbound methods, but does allow for getting attributes on either"
" -- both return the attribute value on the underlying function object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:146
msgid ""
"A future PEP might propose to implement setting (bound or unbound) method"
" attributes by setting attributes on the instance or class, using special"
" naming conventions.  I.e.::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:163
msgid ""
"Here, a lookup on the instance would look to the instance's dictionary "
"first, followed by a lookup on the class's dictionary, and finally a "
"lookup on the function object's dictionary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:168
msgid ""
"Currently, Python supports function attributes only on Python functions "
"(i.e. those that are written in Python, not those that are built-in).  "
"Should it be worthwhile, a separate patch can be crafted that will add "
"function attributes to built-ins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:173
msgid ""
"``__doc__`` is the only function attribute that currently has syntactic "
"support for conveniently setting.  It may be worthwhile to eventually "
"enhance the language for supporting easy function attribute setting.  "
"Here are some syntaxes suggested by PEP reviewers::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:197
msgid ""
"The BDFL is currently against any such special syntactic support for "
"setting arbitrary function attributes.  Any syntax proposals would have "
"to be outlined in new PEPs."

msgid "Dissenting Opinion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:205
msgid ""
"When this was discussed on the python-dev mailing list in April 2000, a "
"number of dissenting opinions were voiced.  For completeness, the "
"discussion thread starts on `python-dev`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:211
msgid "The dissenting arguments appear to fall under the following categories:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:214
msgid "no clear purpose (what does it buy you?)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:215
msgid "other ways to do it (e.g. mappings as class attributes)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:216
msgid "useless until syntactic support is included"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:218
msgid ""
"Countering some of these arguments is the observation that with vanilla "
"Python 2.0, ``__doc__`` can in fact be set to any type of object, so some"
" semblance of writable function attributes are already feasible.  But "
"that approach is yet another corruption of ``__doc__``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:224
msgid ""
"And while it is of course possible to add mappings to class objects (or "
"in the case of function attributes, to the function's module), it is more"
" difficult and less obvious how to extract the attribute values for "
"inspection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0232.txt:229
msgid ""
"Finally, it may be desirable to add syntactic support, much the same way "
"that ``__doc__`` syntactic support exists.  This can be considered "
"separately from the ability to actually set and get function attributes."

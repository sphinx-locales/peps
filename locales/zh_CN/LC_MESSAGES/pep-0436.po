msgid "Rationale and Goals"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:24
msgid ""
"The primary implementation of Python, \"CPython\", is written in a "
"mixture of Python and C.  One implementation detail of CPython is what "
"are called \"built-in\" functions -- functions available to Python "
"programs but written in C.  When a Python program calls a built-in "
"function and passes in arguments, those arguments must be translated from"
" Python values into C values.  This process is called \"parsing "
"arguments\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:32
msgid ""
"As of CPython 3.3, builtin functions nearly always parse their arguments "
"with one of two functions: the original ``PyArg_ParseTuple()``, [1]_ and "
"the more modern ``PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords()``. [2]_ The former only "
"handles positional parameters; the latter also accommodates keyword and "
"keyword-only parameters, and is preferred for new code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:38
msgid ""
"With either function, the caller specifies the translation for parsing "
"arguments in a \"format string\": [3]_ each parameter corresponds to a "
"\"format unit\", a short character sequence telling the parsing function "
"what Python types to accept and how to translate them into the "
"appropriate C value for that parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:45
msgid ""
"``PyArg_ParseTuple()`` was reasonable when it was first conceived. There "
"were only a dozen or so of these \"format units\"; each one was distinct,"
" and easy to understand and remember. But over the years the "
"``PyArg_Parse`` interface has been extended in numerous ways.  The modern"
" API is complex, to the point that it is somewhat painful to use.  "
"Consider:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:52
msgid ""
"There are now forty different \"format units\"; a few are even three "
"characters long.  This makes it difficult for the programmer to "
"understand what the format string says--or even perhaps to parse it--"
"without constantly cross-indexing it with the documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:56
msgid ""
"There are also six meta-format units that may be buried in the format "
"string.  (They are: ``\"()|$:;\"``.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:58
msgid ""
"The more format units are added, the less likely it is the implementer "
"can pick an easy-to-use mnemonic for the format unit, because the "
"character of choice is probably already in use.  In other words, the more"
" format units we have, the more obtuse the format units become."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0436.txt:63
msgid ""
"Several format units are nearly identical to others, having only subtle "
"differences.  This makes understanding the exact semantics of the format "

" format unit you want."

"Argument Clinic is implemented as a preprocessor.  It draws inspiration "

"block comment, process the contents, and write the output back into your "
"C source file directly after the comment.  The intent is that Clinic's "
"output becomes part of your source code; it's checked in to revision "
"control, and distributed with source packages.  This means that Python "
"will still ship ready-to-build.  It does complicate development slightly;"
" in order to add a new function, or modify the arguments or documentation"

"The \"converter\" is the name of one of the \"converter functions\" "

" parameters will syntactically resemble Python literal values.  These "
"parameters are always optional, permitting all conversion functions to be"
" called without any parameters.  In this case, you may also omit the "

"The \"default\" is a Python literal value.  Default values are optional; "

"dynamically assigned, \"live\" in the generated C code, and although it's"

msgid ""
"On May 14th, 2019 :pep:`581` has been accepted [#]_ without much public "

msgid ""
"**Roundup is the status quo.**  Roundup has been an integral part of the "
"CPython workflow for years.  It is a stable product that has been tested "
"and customized to adapt to our needs as the workflow evolved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:55
msgid ""
"It is possible to gradually improve it and avoid the disruption that a "
"switch to a different system would inevitably bring to the workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:59
msgid ""
"**Open-source and Python powered.**  Roundup is an open-source project "
"and is written in Python.  By using it and supporting it, we also support"
" the Python ecosystem.  Several features developed for bpo have also been"
" ported to upstream Roundup over the years."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:65

"**Fully customizable.**  Roundup can be (and has been) fully customized "
"to fit our needs."

"**Flexible UI.**  While Roundup UI might look dated, it is convenient and"

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:76

"For example, on the issue page, each field (e.g. title, type, versions, "
"status, linked files and PRs, etc.) have appropriate UI elements (input "
"boxes, dropdowns, tables, etc.) that are easy to set and also provide a "
"convenient way to get info about the issue at a glance.  The number of "

":pep:`588` suggests to add a button to migrate issues to GitHub only when"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:303
msgid ""
"**Vendor lock-in.**  GitHub is proprietary and there is risk of vendor "
"lock-in.  Their business model might change and they could shut down "

"GitHub after Microsoft acquisition."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:312
msgid ""
"**Required bpo updates.**  bpo will need to be updated in order to add a "
"button that, once pressed, creates a new issue on GitHub, copies over all"
" the messages, attachments, and creates/adds labels for the existing "
"fields.  Permissions will also need to be tweaked to make individual "
"issues read-only once they are migrated, and to prevent users to create "
"new accounts.  It might be necessary to set up redirects (see below)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:320
msgid ""
"**Two trackers.**  If issues are migrated on demand, the issues will be "
"split between two trackers.  Referencing and searching issues will take "
"significant more effort."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:324
msgid ""
"**Lossy conversion.**  GitHub only mechanism to add custom metadata is "
"through labels.  bpo uses a number of fields to specify several different"
" metadata.  Preserving all fields and values will result in too many "
"labels.  If only some fields and values are preserved the others will be "
"lost (unless there is a way to preserve them elsewhere)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:331
msgid ""
"**Issue IDs preservation.**  GitHub doesn't provide a way to set and "
"preserve the ID of migrated issues. Some projects managed to preserve the"
" IDs by contacting the GitHub staff and migrating the issues *en masse*."
"  However, this is no longer possible, since PRs and issues share the "
"same namespace and PRs already use existing bpo issue IDs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:338

"**Internal issue links preservation.**  Existing issues might contain "
"references to other issues in messages and fields (e.g. dependencies or "
"superseder).  Since the issue ID will change during the migration, these "
"will need to be updated.  If the issues are migrated on demand, all the "
"existing internal references to the migrated issues (on both bpo and "
"GitHub issues) will have to be updated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:346
msgid ""
"Setting up a redirect for each migrated issue on bpo might mitigate the "
"issue, however -- if references in migrated messages are not updated -- "
"it will cause confusion (e.g. if bpo issue ``#1234`` becomes GitHub issue"
" ``#4321``, a reference to ``#1234`` in a migrated message could link to "
"bpo ``#1234`` and bpo can redirect to GitHub issue ``#4321``, but new "
"references to ``#1234`` will link to GitHub PR ``#1234`` rather than "
"GitHub issue ``#4321``). Manually having to specify a ``bpo-`` or ``gh-``"
" prefix is error prone."

msgid ""
"**External issue links preservation.**  A number of websites, mails, etc."
" link to bpo issues.  If bpo is shut down, these links will break.  If we"

" a redirect system that links to the corresponding GitHub issue."

"**References preservation and updating.**  In addition to issue "
"references, bpo converts a number of other references into links, "
"including message and PR IDs, changeset numbers, legacy SVN revision "
"numbers, paths to files in the repo, files in tracebacks (detecting the "
"correct branch), and links to devguide pages and sections [#]_."

"Since Roundup converts references to links when messages are requested, "
"it is possible to update the target and generate the correct link.  This "
"need already arose several times, for example: files and HG changesets "
"moved from ``hg.python.org`` to GitHub and the devguide moved from "
"``docs.python.org/devguide`` to ``devguide.python.org``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0595.rst:378
msgid ""
"Since messages on GitHub are static, the links will need to be generated "

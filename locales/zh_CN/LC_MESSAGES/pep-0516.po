"We discussed having an sdist verb. The main driver for this was to make "

"existing source trees isn't a thing pip does today, and while there is a "
"PR to do that as part of building from source, it is contentious and "
"lacks consensus. Rather than impose a requirement on all build systems, "
"we are treating it as a YAGNI, and will add such a verb in a future "
"version of the interface if required. The existing PEP-314 [#pep314] "
"requirements for sdists still apply, and distutils or setuptools users "
"can use ``setup.py sdist`` to create an sdist. Other tools should create "
"sdists compatible with PEP-314 [#pep314]. Note that pip itself does not "

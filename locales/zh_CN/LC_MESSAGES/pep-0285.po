"This PEP proposes the introduction of a new built-in type, bool, with two"
" constants, ``False`` and ``True``.  The bool type would be a "
"straightforward subtype (in C) of the int type, and the values ``False`` "
"and ``True`` would behave like 0 and 1 in most respects (for example, "
"``False==0`` and ``True==1`` would be true) except ``repr()`` and "
"``str()``.  All built-in operations that conceptually return a Boolean "
"result will be changed to return ``False`` or ``True`` instead of 0 or 1;"

"In an ideal world, bool might be better implemented as a separate integer"

"Some reviewers have argued for boolean instead of bool, because this "

msgid ""
"Many programmers apparently feel the need for a Boolean type; most Python"
" documentation contains a bit of an apology for the absence of a Boolean "
"type.  I've seen lots of modules that defined constants \"False=0\" and "
"\"True=1\" (or similar) at the top and used those.  The problem with this"
" is that everybody does it differently.  For example, should you use "
"\"FALSE\", \"false\", \"False\", \"F\" or even \"f\"?  And should false "
"be the value zero or None, or perhaps a truth value of a different type "
"that will print as \"true\" or \"false\"?  Adding a standard bool type to"
" the language resolves those issues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0285.txt:159
msgid ""
"Some external libraries (like databases and RPC packages) need to be able"
" to distinguish between Boolean and integral values, and while it's "
"usually possible to craft a solution, it would be easier if the language "
"offered a standard Boolean type.  This also applies to Jython: some Java "
"classes have separately overloaded methods or constructors for int and "
"boolean arguments.  The bool type can be used to select the boolean "
"variant.  (The same is apparently the case for some COM interfaces.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0285.txt:168
msgid ""
"The standard bool type can also serve as a way to force a value to be "
"interpreted as a Boolean, which can be used to normalize Boolean values."
"  When a Boolean value needs to be normalized to one of two values, "
"``bool(x)`` is much clearer than \"not not x\" and much more concise than"

msgid ""
"This PEP proposes the inclusion of a pip bootstrap executable in the "

"users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:24
msgid ""
"This PEP does not propose to include the pip implementation in the Python"
" standard library.  Nor does it propose to implement any package "

msgid "PEP Rejection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:33
msgid ""
"This PEP has been rejected in favour of a more explicit mechanism that "
"should achieve the same end result in a more reliable fashion. The more "
"explicit bootstrapping mechanism is described in PEP 453."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:38
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:40
msgid ""
"Currently the user story for installing 3rd-party Python modules is not "
"as simple as it could be.  It requires that all 3rd-party modules inform "
"the user of how to install the installer, typically via a link to the "
"installer.  That link may be out of date or the steps required to perform"
" the install of the installer may be enough of a roadblock to prevent the"
" user from further progress."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:47
msgid ""
"Large Python projects which emphasise a low barrier to entry have shied "
"away from depending on third party packages because of the introduction "
"of this potential stumbling block for new users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:51
msgid ""
"With the inclusion of the package installer command in the standard "
"Python installation the barrier to installing additional software is "
"considerably reduced.  It is hoped that this will therefore increase the "
"likelihood that Python projects will reuse third party software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:56
msgid ""
"The Python community also has an issue of complexity around the current "
"bootstrap procedure for pip and setuptools. They all have their own "
"bootstrap download file with slightly different usages and even refer to "
"each other in some cases. Having a single bootstrap which is common "
"amongst them all, with a simple usage, would be far preferable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:62
msgid ""
"It is also hoped that this is reduces the number of proposals to include "
"more and more software in the Python standard library, and therefore that"
" more popular Python software is more easily upgradeable beyond requiring"
" Python installation upgrades."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:69
msgid "Proposal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:71
msgid ""
"The bootstrap will install the pip implementation, setuptools by "
"downloading their installation files from PyPI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:74
msgid ""
"This proposal affects two components of packaging: `the pip bootstrap`_ "
"and, thanks to easier package installation, `modifications to publishing "
"packages`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:78
msgid ""
"The core of this proposal is that the user experience of using pip should"
" not require the user to install pip."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:83
msgid "The pip bootstrap"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:85
msgid ""
"The Python installation includes an executable called \"pip3\" (see PEP "
"394 for naming rationale etc.) that attempts to import pip machinery.  If"
" it can then the pip command proceeds as normal.  If it cannot it will "
"bootstrap pip by downloading the pip implementation and setuptools wheel "
"files. Hereafter the installation of the \"pip implementation\" will "
"imply installation of setuptools and virtualenv.  Once installed, the pip"
" command proceeds as normal. Once the bootstrap process is complete the "
"\"pip3\" command is no longer the bootstrap but rather the full pip "
"command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:94
msgid ""
"A bootstrap is used in the place of a the full pip code so that we don't "
"have to bundle pip and also pip is upgradeable outside of the regular "
"Python upgrade timeframe and processes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:98
msgid ""
"To avoid issues with sudo we will have the bootstrap default to "
"installing the pip implementation to the per-user site-packages directory"
" defined in PEP 370 and implemented in Python 2.6/3.0.  Since we avoid "
"installing to the system Python we also avoid conflicting with any other "
"packaging system (on Linux systems, for example.) If the user is inside a"
" virtual environment [1]_ then the pip implementation will be installed "
"into that virtual environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:106
msgid "The bootstrap process will proceed as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:108
msgid ""
"The user system has Python (3.4+) installed.  In the \"scripts\" "
"directory of the Python installation there is the bootstrap script called"
" \"pip3\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:111
msgid ""
"The user will invoke a pip command, typically \"pip3 install <package>\","
" for example \"pip3 install Django\"."

"The bootstrap script will attempt to import the pip implementation. If "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:115
msgid ""
"On failing to import the pip implementation the bootstrap notifies the "
"user that it needs to \"install pip\". It will ask the user whether it "
"should install pip as a system-wide site-packages or as a user-only "
"package. This choice will also be present as a command-line option to pip"
" so non-interactive use is possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:120

"The bootstrap will and contact PyPI to obtain the latest download wheel "
"file (see PEP 427.)"

"process the requested user command normally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:126
msgid ""
"Users may be running in an environment which cannot access the public "
"Internet and are relying solely on a local package repository.  They "
"would use the \"-i\" (Base URL of Python Package Index) argument to the "
"\"pip3 install\" command. This simply overrides the default index URL "
"pointing to PyPI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:132
msgid ""
"Some users may have no Internet access suitable for fetching the pip "
"implementation file. These users can manually download and install the "
"setuptools and pip tar files. Adding specific support for this use-case "
"is unnecessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:137
msgid ""
"The download of the pip implementation install file will be performed "
"securely.  The transport from pypi.python.org will be done over HTTPS "
"with the CA certificate check performed. This facility will be present in"
" Python 3.4+ using Operating System certificates (see PEP XXXX)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:142
msgid ""
"Beyond those arguments controlling index location and download options, "
"the \"pip3\" bootstrap command may support further standard pip options "
"for verbosity, quietness and logging."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:146
msgid ""
"The \"pip3\" command will support two new command-line options that are "
"used in the bootstrapping, and otherwise ignored. They control where the "
"pip implementation is installed:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:170
msgid ""
"An additional new Python package is proposed, \"pypublish\", which will "
"be a tool for publishing packages to PyPI.  It would replace the current "
"\"python setup.py register\" and \"python setup.py upload\" distutils "
"commands.  Again because of the measured Python release cycle and "
"extensive existing Python installations these commands are difficult to "
"bugfix and extend.  Additionally it is desired that the \"register\" and "
"\"upload\" commands be able to be performed over HTTPS with certificate "
"validation.  Since shipping CA certificate keychains with Python is not "
"really feasible (updating the keychain is quite difficult to manage) it "
"is desirable that those commands, and the accompanying keychain, be made "
"installable and upgradeable outside of Python itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:183
msgid ""
"The existing distutils mechanisms for package registration and upload "
"would remain, though with a deprecation warning."

"The changes to pip required by this PEP are being tracked in that "

"and --bootstrap- to-system to the pip command-line."
msgstr ""

"It would be preferable that the pip and setuptools projects distribute a "
"wheel format download."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:197
msgid ""
"The required code for this implementation is the \"pip3\" command "
"described above. The additional pypublish can be developed outside of the"
" scope of this PEP's work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0439.txt:201
msgid ""
"Finally, it would be desirable that \"pip3\" be ported to Python 2.6+ to "
"allow the single command to replace existing pip, setuptools and "
"virtualenv (which would be added to the bootstrap) bootstrap scripts. "
"Having that bootstrap included in a future Python 2.7 release would also "
"be highly desirable."

msgid ""
"There is a Perl package installer also named \"pip\". It is quite rare "
"and not commonly used. The Fedora variant of Linux has historically named"
" Python's \"pip\" as \"python-pip\" and Perl's \"pip\" as \"perl-pip\".  "
"This policy has been altered\\ [3]_ so that future and upgraded Fedora "
"installations will use the name \"pip\" for Python's \"pip\". Existing "
"(non-upgraded) installations will still have the old name for the Python "

"No new modules are to be added to this PEP.  It has been deemed dangerous"

"There are many great pieces of Python software developed outside of the "
"Python standard library (a.k.a., the \"stdlib\").  Sometimes it makes "
"sense to incorporate these externally maintained packages into the stdlib"
" in order to fill a gap in the tools provided by Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0360.txt:28
msgid ""
"But by having the packages maintained externally it means Python's "
"developers do not have direct control over the packages' evolution and "
"maintenance.  Some package developers prefer to have bug reports and "
"patches go through them first instead of being directly applied to "
"Python's repository."

"This PEP is meant to record details of packages in the stdlib that are "
"maintained outside of Python's repository.  Specifically, it is meant to "
"keep track of any specific maintenance needs for each package.  It should"
" be mentioned that changes needed in order to fix bugs and keep the code "
"running on all of Python's supported platforms will be done directly in "
"Python's repository without worrying about going through the contact "
"developer.  This is so that Python itself is not held up by a single bug "
"and allows the whole process to scale as needed."

"package is named within Python.  The \"contact person\" is the Python "
"developer in charge of maintaining the package.  The \"synchronisation "
"history\" lists what external version of the package was included in each"
" version of Python (if different from the previous Python release)."

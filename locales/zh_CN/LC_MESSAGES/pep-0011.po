msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:26
msgid ""
"Over time, the CPython source code has collected various pieces of "
"platform-specific code, which, at some point in time, was considered "
"necessary to use Python on a specific platform. Without access to this "
"platform, it is not possible to determine whether this code is still "
"needed.  As a result, this code may either break during Python's "
"evolution, or it may become unnecessary as the platforms evolve as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:34
msgid ""
"The growing amount of these fragments poses the risk of "
"unmaintainability: without having experts for a large number of "
"platforms, it is not possible to determine whether a certain change to "
"the CPython source code will work on all supported platforms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:40
msgid ""
"To reduce this risk, this PEP specifies what is required for a platform "
"to be considered supported by Python as well as providing a procedure to "
"remove code for platforms with few or no Python users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:46
msgid "Supporting platforms"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:48
msgid ""
"Gaining official platform support requires two things. First, a core "
"developer needs to volunteer to maintain platform-specific code. This "
"core developer can either already be a member of the Python development "
"team or be given contributor rights on the basis of maintaining platform "
"support (it is at the discretion of the Python development team to decide"
" if a person is ready to have such rights even if it is just for "
"supporting a specific platform)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:56
msgid ""
"Second, a stable buildbot must be provided [2]_. This guarantees that "
"platform support will not be accidentally broken by a Python core "
"developer who does not have personal access to the platform. For a "
"buildbot to be considered stable it requires that the machine be reliably"
" up and functioning (but it is up to the Python core developers to decide"
" whether to promote a buildbot to being considered stable)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:64
msgid ""
"This policy does not disqualify supporting other platforms indirectly. "
"Patches which are not platform-specific but still done to add platform "
"support will be considered for inclusion. For example, if platform-"
"independent changes were necessary in the configure script which were "
"motivated to support a specific platform that could be accepted. Patches "
"which add platform-specific code such as the name of a specific platform "
"to the configure script will generally not be accepted without the "
"platform having official support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:73
msgid ""
"CPU architecture and compiler support are viewed in a similar manner as "
"platforms. For example, to consider the ARM architecture supported a "
"buildbot running on ARM would be required along with support from the "
"Python development team. In general it is not required to have a CPU "
"architecture run under every possible platform in order to be considered "
"supported."

msgid ""
"If a certain platform that currently has special code in CPython is "
"deemed to be without enough Python users or lacks proper support from the"
" Python development team and/or a buildbot, a note must be posted in this"
" PEP that this platform is no longer actively supported.  This note must "
"include:"

msgid ""
"In some cases, it is not possible to identify the specific list of "
"systems for which some code is used (e.g. when autoconf tests for absence"
" of some feature which is considered present on all supported systems).  "
"In this case, the name will give the precise condition (usually a "
"preprocessor symbol) that will become unsupported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:102
msgid ""
"At the same time, the CPython source code must be changed to produce a "
"build-time error if somebody tries to install Python on this platform.  "
"On platforms using autoconf, configure must fail. This gives potential "
"users of the platform a chance to step forward and offer maintenance."

"may volunteer to maintain the platform support.  Such an offer must be "
"recorded in the PEP, and the user can submit patches to remove the build-"
"time errors, and perform any other maintenance work for the platform."

msgid ""
"Microsoft has established a policy called product support lifecycle [1]_."
" Each product's lifecycle has a mainstream support phase, where the "
"product is generally commercially available, and an extended support "
"phase, where paid support is still available, and certain bug fixes are "
"released (in particular security fixes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0011.txt:127
msgid ""
"CPython's Windows support now follows this lifecycle. A new feature "
"release X.Y.0 will support all Windows releases whose extended support "

"extended support phase has ended)."

msgid ""
"Each feature release is built by a specific version of Microsoft Visual "
"Studio. That version should have mainstream support when the release is "
"made. Developers of extension modules will generally need to use the same"
" Visual Studio release; they are concerned both with the availability of "
"the versions they need to use, and with keeping the zoo of versions "
"small. The CPython source tree will keep unmaintained build files for "
"older Visual Studio releases, for which patches will be accepted. Such "
"build files will be removed from the source tree 3 years after the "
"extended support for the compiler has ended (but continue to remain "
"available in revision control)."

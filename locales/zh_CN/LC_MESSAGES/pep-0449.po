msgid ""
"This PEP provides a path to deprecate and ultimately remove the auto "
"discovery of PyPI mirrors as well as the hard coded naming scheme which "
"requires delegating a domain name under pypi.python.org to a third party."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:26
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:28
msgid ""
"The PyPI mirroring infrastructure (defined in `PEP381`_) provides a means"
" to mirror the content of PyPI used by the automatic installers. It also "
"provides a method for auto discovery of mirrors and a consistent naming "
"scheme."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:32
msgid ""
"There are a number of problems with the auto discovery protocol and the "
"naming scheme:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:35
msgid ""
"They give control over a \\*.python.org domain name to a third party, "
"allowing that third party to set or read cookies on the pypi.python.org "
"and python.org domain name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:38
msgid ""
"The use of a sub domain of pypi.python.org means that the mirror "
"operators will never be able to get a SSL certificate of their own, and "
"giving them one for a python.org domain name is unlikely to happen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:41
msgid "The auto discovery uses an unauthenticated protocol (DNS)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:42
msgid ""
"The lack of a TLS certificate on these domains means that clients can not"
" be sure that they have not been a victim of DNS poisoning or a MITM "
"attack."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:44
msgid ""
"The auto discovery protocol was designed to enable a client to "
"automatically select a mirror for use. This is no longer a requirement "
"because the CDN that PyPI is now using a globally distributed network of "
"servers which will automatically select one close to the client without "
"any effort on the clients part."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:49
msgid ""
"The auto discovery protocol and use of the consistent naming scheme has "
"only ever been implemented by one installer (pip), and its "
"implementation, besides being insecure, has serious issues with "
"performance and is slated for removal with its next release (1.5)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:53
msgid ""
"While there are provisions in `PEP381`_ that would solve *some* of these "
"issues for a dedicated client it would not solve the issues that affect a"
" users browser. Additionally these provisions have not been implemented "
"by any installer to date."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:58
msgid ""
"Due to the number of issues, some of them very serious, and the CDN which"
" provides most of the benefit of the auto discovery and consistent naming"
" scheme this PEP proposes to first deprecate and then remove the "
"[a..z].pypi.python.org names for mirrors and the last.pypi.python.org "
"name for the auto discovery protocol. The ability to mirror and the "
"method of mirror will not be affected and will continue to exist as "
"written in `PEP381`_. Operators of existing mirrors are encouraged to "
"acquire their own domains and certificates to use for their mirrors if "
"they wish to continue hosting them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Plan for Deprecation & Removal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:71
msgid ""
"Immediately upon acceptance of this PEP documentation on PyPI will be "
"updated to reflect the deprecated nature of the official public mirrors "
"and will direct users to external resources like http://www.pypi-"
"mirrors.org/ to discover unofficial public mirrors if they wish to use "
"one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:76
msgid ""
"Mirror operators, if they wish to continue operating their mirror, should"
" acquire a domain name to represent their mirror and, if they are able, a"
" TLS certificate. Once they have acquired a domain they should redirect "
"their assigned N.pypi.python.org domain name to their new domain. On Feb "
"15th, 2014 the DNS entries for [a..z].pypi.python.org and "
"last.pypi.python.org will be removed. At any time prior to Feb 15th, 2014"
" a mirror operator may request that their domain name be reclaimed by "
"PyPI and pointed back at the master."

msgid "Why Feb 15th, 2014"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:88
msgid ""
"The most critical decision of this PEP is the final cut off date. If the "
"date is too soon then it needlessly punishes people by forcing them to "
"drop everything to update their deployment scripts. If the date is too "
"far away then the extended period of time does not help with the "
"migration effort and merely puts off the migration until a later date."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:94
msgid ""
"The date of Feb 15th, 2014 has been chosen because it is roughly 6 months"
" from the date of the PEP. This should ensure a lengthy period of time to"
" enable people to update their deployment procedures to point to the new "
"domains names without merely padding the cut off date."

msgid ""
"While it would be possible to simply reclaim the domain names used in "
"mirror and direct them back at PyPI in order to prevent users from "
"needing to update configurations to point away from those domains this "
"has a number of issues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:107
msgid ""
"Anyone who currently has these names hard coded in their configuration "
"has them hard coded as HTTP. This means that by allowing these names to "
"continue resolving we make it simple for a MITM operator to attack users "
"by rewriting the redirect to HTTPS prior to giving it to the client."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:111
msgid ""
"The overhead of maintaining several domains pointing at PyPI has proved "
"troublesome for the small number of N.pypi.python.org domains that have "
"already been reclaimed. They oftentimes get mis-configured when things "
"change on the service which often leaves them broken for months at a time"
" until somebody notices. By leaving them in we leave users of these "
"domains open to random breakages which are less likely to get caught or "
"noticed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:117
msgid ""
"People using these domains have explicitly chosen to use them for one "
"reason or another. One such reason may be because they do not wish to "
"deploy from a host located in a particular country. If these domains "
"continue to resolve but do not point at their existing locations we have "
"silently removed this choice from the existing users of those domains."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0449.txt:123
msgid ""
"That being said, removing the entries *will* require users who have "
"modified their configuration to either point back at the master (PyPI) or"
" select a new mirror name to point at. This is regarded as a regrettable "
"requirement to protect PyPI itself and the users of the mirrors from the "
"attacks outlined above or, at the very least, require them to make an "
"informed decision about the insecurity."

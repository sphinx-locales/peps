msgid ""
"Guido wrote the original implementation of Python in 1989, and after "
"nearly 20 years of leading the community, has decided to step aside as "
"its Benevolent Dictator For Life.  His official title is now Benevolent "
"Dictator Emeritus Vacationing Indefinitely from the Language (BDEVIL).  "
"Guido leaves Python in the good hands of its new leader and its vibrant "
"community, in order to train for his lifelong dream of climbing Mount "
"Everest."

"After unanimous vote of the Python Steering Union (not to be confused "
"with the Python Secret Underground, which emphatically does not exist) at"
" the 2009 Python Conference (PyCon_ 2009), Guido's successor has been "
"chosen: Barry Warsaw, or as he is affectionately known, Uncle Barry. "
"Uncle Barry's official title is Friendly Language Uncle For Life (FLUFL)."

"Recognized that the selection of ``Hg`` as the DVCS of choice was clear "
"proof of the onset of the BDEVIL's insanity, and reverting this decision "
"to switch to ``Bzr`` instead, the only true choice."

msgid ""
"Recognized that the ``!=`` inequality operator in Python 3.0 was a "
"horrible, finger pain inducing mistake, the FLUFL reinstates the ``<>`` "
"diamond operator as the sole spelling.  This change is important enough "
"to be implemented for, and released in Python 3.1. To help transition to "
"this feature, a new future statement, ``from __future__ import "
"barry_as_FLUFL`` has been added."

"Recognized that the disappointing adoption curve of Python 3.0 signals "

"ported to Python 2.7 which will be the official and sole next release.  "
"The Python 3.0 string and bytes types will be back ported to Python 2.6.2"

"Recognized that C is a 20th-century language with almost universal "
"rejection by programmers under the age of 30, the CPython implementation "
"will terminate with the release of Python 2.6.2 and 3.0.2.  Thereafter, "
"the reference implementation of Python will target the Parrot [1]_ "
"virtual machine.  Alternative implementations of Python (e.g. Jython "
"[2]_, IronPython [3]_, and PyPy [4]_) are officially discouraged but "

"Recognized that the Python Software Foundation [5]_ having fulfilled its "

"(not to be confused with the Python Secret Underground, which "
"emphatically does not exist), is now the sole steward for all of Python's"
" intellectual property.  All PSF funds are hereby transferred to the PSU "

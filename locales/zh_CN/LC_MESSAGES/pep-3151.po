"The standard exception hierarchy is an important part of the Python "
"language.  It has two defining qualities: it is both generic and "
"selective.  Generic in that the same exception type can be raised - and "
"handled - regardless of the context (for example, whether you are trying "
"to add something to an integer, to call a string method, or to write an "
"object on a socket, a TypeError will be raised for bad argument types). "
"Selective in that it allows the user to easily handle (silence, examine, "
"process, store or encapsulate...) specific kinds of error conditions "
"while letting other errors bubble up to higher calling contexts.  For "
"example, you can choose to catch ZeroDivisionErrors without affecting the"
" default handling of other ArithmeticErrors (such as OverflowErrors)."

"While some of these distinctions can be explained by implementation "
"considerations, they are often not very logical at a higher level.  The "

"Consider the following::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3151.txt:73
msgid ""
"The same error condition (a non-existing file) gets cast as two different"
" exceptions depending on which library function was called.  The reason "
"for this is that the ``os`` module exclusively raises OSError (or its "
"subclass WindowsError) while the ``io`` module mostly raises IOError. "
"However, the user is interested in the nature of the error, not in which "
"part of the interpreter it comes from (since the latter is obvious from "
"reading the traceback message or application source code)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3151.txt:81
msgid ""
"In fact, it is hard to think of any situation where OSError should be "
"caught but not IOError, or the reverse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3151.txt:84
msgid ""
"A further proof of the ambiguity of this segmentation is that the "
"standard library itself sometimes has problems deciding.  For example, in"
" the ``select`` module, similar failures will raise ``select.error``, "
"``OSError`` or ``IOError`` depending on whether you are using select(), a"
" poll object, a kqueue object, or an epoll object.  This makes user code "
"uselessly complicated since it has to be prepared to catch various "
"exception types, depending on which exact implementation of a single "
"primitive it chooses to use at runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3151.txt:93
msgid ""
"As for WindowsError, it seems to be a pointless distinction.  First, it "
"only exists on Windows systems, which requires tedious compatibility code"
" in cross-platform applications (such code can be found in "
"``Lib/shutil.py``). Second, it inherits from OSError and is raised for "
"similar errors as OSError is raised for on other systems. Third, the user"
" wanting access to low-level exception specifics has to examine the "
"``errno`` or ``winerror`` attribute anyway."

"The current variety of OS-related exceptions doesn't allow the user to "

"``mmap.error``, ``WindowsError``, ``select.error`` without checking the "
"``errno`` attribute.  This is because such exception types are much too "
"broad to signify anything.  Any of them can be raised for error "
"conditions as diverse as: a bad file descriptor (which will usually "
"indicate a programming error), an unconnected socket (ditto), a socket "

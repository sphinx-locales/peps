"The standard Python distribution includes a directory ``Lib/site-"
"packages``, which is used on Unix platforms to hold locally installed "
"modules and packages.  The ``site.py`` module distributed with Python "
"includes support for locating other modules in the site-packages "
"directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:23

"This PEP proposes that the site-packages directory should be used on the "
"Windows platform in a similar manner."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:30
msgid ""
"On Windows platforms, the default setting for ``sys.path`` does not "
"include a directory suitable for users to install locally developed "
"modules.  The \"expected\" location appears to be the directory "
"containing the Python executable itself.  This is also the location where"
" distutils (and distutils-generated installers) installs packages.  "
"Including locally developed code in the same directory as installed "
"executables is not good practice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:38
msgid ""
"Clearly, users can manipulate ``sys.path``, either in a locally modified "
"``site.py``, or in a suitable ``sitecustomize.py``, or even via ``.pth`` "
"files.  However, there should be a standard location for such files, "
"rather than relying on every individual site having to set their own "
"policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:44
msgid ""
"In addition, with distutils becoming more prevalent as a means of "
"distributing modules, the need for a standard install location for "
"distributed modules will become more common.  It would be better to "
"define such a standard now, rather than later when more distutils-based "
"packages exist which will need rebuilding."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:50
msgid ""
"It is relevant to note that prior to Python 2.1, the site-packages "
"directory was not included in ``sys.path`` for Macintosh platforms. This "
"has been changed in 2.1, and Macintosh includes ``sys.path`` now, leaving"
" Windows as the only major platform with no site-specific modules "
"directory."

msgid "Implementation"

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:60
msgid ""
"The implementation of this feature is fairly trivial.  All that would be "
"required is a change to ``site.py``, to change the section setting "
"sitedirs.  The Python 2.1 version has::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:75
msgid "A suitable change would be to simply replace the last 4 lines with::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:80
msgid ""
"Changes would also be required to distutils, to reflect this change in "
"policy. A patch is available on Sourceforge, patch ID 445744, which "
"implements this change.  Note that the patch checks the Python version "
"and only invokes the new behaviour for Python versions from 2.2 onwards. "
"This is to ensure that distutils remains compatible with earlier versions"
" of Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:87
msgid ""
"Finally, the executable code which implements the Windows installer used "
"by the ``bdist_wininst`` command will need changing to use the new "
"location.  A separate patch is available for this, currently maintained "
"by Thomas Heller."

"This change does not preclude packages using the current location -- the "
"change only adds a directory to ``sys.path``, it does not remove "
"anything."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:100
msgid ""
"Both the current location (``sys.prefix``) and the new directory (site-"
"packages) are included in sitedirs, so that ``.pth`` files will be "
"recognised in either location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:104
msgid ""
"This proposal adds a single additional site-packages directory to "
"sitedirs. On Unix platforms, two directories are added, one for version-"
"independent files (Python code) and one for version-dependent code (C "
"extensions). This is necessary on Unix, as the sitedirs include a common "
"(across Python versions) package location, in ``/usr/local`` by default. "
"As there is no such common location available on Windows, there is also "
"no need for having two separate package directories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0250.txt:113
msgid ""
"If users want to keep DLLs in a single location on Windows, rather than "
"keeping them in the package directory, the DLLs subdirectory of the "
"Python install directory is already available for that purpose. Adding an"
" extra directory solely for DLLs should not be necessary."

"PEPs."

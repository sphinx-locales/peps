msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:62
msgid ""
"1. Do we collectively agree that \"existence checking\" is a useful "
"general concept that exists in software development and is distinct from "
"the concept of \"truth checking\"? 2. Do we collectively agree that the "
"Python ecosystem would benefit from an existence checking protocol that "
"permits generalisation of algorithms (especially short circuiting ones) "
"across different \"data missing\" indicators, including those defined in "
"the language definition, the standard library, and custom user code? 3. "
"Do we collectively agree that it would be easier to use such a protocol "
"effectively if existence-checking equivalents to the truth-checking "
"\"and\" and \"or\" control flow operators were available?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:74
msgid ""
"While the answers to the first question were generally positive, it "
"quickly became clear that the answer to the second question is \"No\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:77
msgid ""
"Steven D'Aprano articulated the counter-argument well in [5_], but the "
"general idea is that when checking for \"missing data\" sentinels, we're "
"almost always looking for a *specific* sentinel value, rather than *any* "
"sentinel value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:81
msgid ""
"``NotImplemented`` exists, for example, due to ``None`` being a "
"potentially legitimate result from overloaded arithmetic operators and "
"exception handling imposing too much runtime overhead to be useful for "
"operand coercion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:85
msgid ""
"Similarly, ``Ellipsis`` exists for multi-dimensional slicing support due "
"to ``None`` already have another meaning in a slicing context (indicating"
" the use of the default start or stop indices, or the default step size)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:89
msgid ""
"In mathematics, the value of ``NaN`` is that *programmatically* it "
"behaves like a normal value of its type (e.g. exposing all the usual "
"attributes and methods), while arithmetically it behaves according to the"
" mathematical rules for handling ``NaN`` values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:94
msgid ""
"With that core design concept invalidated, the proposal as a whole "
"doesn't make sense, and it is accordingly withdrawn."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:97
msgid ""
"However, the discussion of the proposal did prompt consideration of a "
"potential protocol based approach to make the existing ``and``, ``or`` "
"and ``if-else`` operators more flexible [6_] without introducing any new "
"syntax, so I'll be writing that up as another possible alternative to PEP"

"An increasingly common requirement in modern software development is the "
"need to work with \"semi-structured data\": data where the structure of "
"the data is known in advance, but pieces of it may be missing at runtime,"
" and the software manipulating that data is expected to degrade "
"gracefully (e.g. by omitting results that depend on the missing data) "
"rather than failing outright."

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:140
msgid ""
"It is the latter two cases that are the primary motivation for this PEP -"
" while needing to deal with optional configuration settings and "
"parameters is a design requirement at least as old as Python itself, the "
"rise of public cloud infrastructure, the development of software systems "
"as collaborative networks of distributed services, and the availability "
"of large public and private data sets for analysis means that the ability"
" to degrade operations gracefully in the face of partial service failures"
" or partial data availability is becoming an essential feature of modern "
"programming environments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0531.txt:149
msgid ""
"At the moment, writing such software in Python can be genuinely awkward, "

"In the first two examples, the 31 character boilerplate clause ``if exprN"

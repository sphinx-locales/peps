msgid ""
"This PEP proposes a new platform tag series ``musllinux`` for binary "
"Python package distributions for a Python installation that depends on "
"musl on a Linux distribution. The tag works similarly to the \"perennial "
"manylinux\" platform tags specified in :pep:`600`, but targeting "
"platforms based on musl instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:26
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:28
msgid ""
"With the wide use of containers, distributions such as Alpine Linux "
"[alpine]_, have been gaining more popularity than ever. Many of them "
"based on musl [musl]_, a different libc implementation from glibc, and "
"therefore cannot use the existing ``manylinux`` platform tags. This means"
" that Python package projects cannot deploy binary distributions on PyPI "
"for them. Users of such projects demand build constraints from those "
"projects, putting unnecessary burden on project maintainers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:38
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:40
msgid ""
"According to the documentation, musl has a stable ABI, and maintains "
"backwards compatibility [musl-compatibility]_ [compare-libcs]_, so a "
"binary compiled against an earlier version of musl is guaranteed to run "
"against a newer musl runtime [musl-compat-ml]_. Therefore, we use a "
"scheme similar to the glibc-version-based manylinux tags, but against "
"musl versions instead of glibc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:47
msgid ""
"Logic behind the new platform tag largely follows :pep:`600` (\"perennial"
" manylinux\"), and requires wheels using this tag make similar promises. "
"Please refer to :pep:`600` for more details on rationale and reasoning "
"behind the design."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:52
msgid ""
"The ``musllinux`` platform tags only apply to Python interpreters "
"dynamically linked against the musl libc and executed on the runtime "
"shared library, on a Linux operating system. Statically linked "
"interpreters or mixed builds with other libc implementations (such as "
"glibc) are out of scope and not supported by platform tags defined in "
"this document. Such interpreters should not claim compatibility with "
"``musllinux`` platform tags."

#: ../../pep-0656.rst:68
msgid ""
"This tag promises the wheel works on any mainstream Linux distribution "
"that uses musl version ``${MUSLMAJOR}.${MUSLMINOR}``, following the "
"perennial design. All other system-level dependency requirements rely on "
"the community's definition to the intentionally vague \"mainstream\" "
"description introduced in :pep:`600`. A wheel may make use of newer "
"system dependencies when all mainstream distributions using the specified"
" musl version provide the dependency by default; once all mainstream "
"distributions on the musl version ship a certain dependency version by "
"default, users relying on older versions are automatically removed from "
"the coverage of that ``musllinux`` tag."

"There are currently two possible ways to find the musl library's location"

"executable's ELF header [elf]_."

"cgi.py: We should not be told to create our own subclass just so we can "
"handle file uploads. As a practical matter, I have yet to find the time "
"to do this right, so I end up reading cgi.py's temp file into, at best, "
"another file. Some of our legacy code actually reads it into a second "
"temp file, then into a final destination! And even if we did, that would "

"associated overhead."

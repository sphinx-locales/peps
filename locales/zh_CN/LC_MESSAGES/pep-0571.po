"True to its name, the ``manylinux1`` platform tag has made the "
"installation of binary extension modules a reality on many Linux systems."

"architectures does not depend on fragile development environments and "
"build toolchains."

msgid ""
"``manylinux1`` wheels achieve their portability by allowing the extension"
" modules they contain to link against only a small set of system-level "
"shared libraries that export versioned symbols old enough to benefit from"
" backwards-compatibility policies.  Extension modules in a ``manylinux1``"
" wheel that rely on ``glibc``, for example, must be built against version"
" 2.5 or earlier; they may then be run systems that provide more recent "
"``glibc`` version that still export the required symbols at version 2.5."

"PEP 513 drew its whitelisted shared libraries and their symbol versions "
"from CentOS 5.11, which was the oldest supported CentOS release at the "
"time of its writing.  Unfortunately, CentOS 5.11 reached its end-of-life "
"on March 31st, 2017 with a clear warning against its continued use. [4]_ "
"No further updates, such as security patches, will be made available.  "
"This means that its packages will remain at obsolete versions that hamper"
" the efforts of Python software packagers who use the ``manylinux1`` "
"Docker image."

"CentOS 6 is now the oldest supported CentOS release, and will receive "

"updated to support it."

"This was originally proposed as ``manylinux2``, but the versioning has "
"been changed to use calendar years (also known as CalVer [23]_). This "

"example, a hypothetical ``manylinux2017`` standard may be defined via a "
"new PEP before ``manylinux2014``, or a ``manylinux2007`` standard might "

"Versions 2.14 and earlier of ``glibc`` require the kernel provide an "

"To effect the optimization, the kernel maps a read-only page of "

"invocation.  ``vsyscall`` has long been deprecated in favor of an "

"compromise, Linux 3.1 implemented an \"emulated\" ``vsyscall`` that "

"In its present form, the ``subprocess.Popen`` implementation is prone to "

"``subprocess.Popen`` more asynchronous to help alleviate these problems."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:41
msgid ""
"A search for \"python asynchronous subprocess\" will turn up numerous "
"accounts of people wanting to execute a child process and communicate "
"with it from time to time reading only the data that is available instead"
" of blocking to wait for the program to produce data [1]_ [2]_ [3]_.  The"
" current behavior of the ``subprocess`` module is that when a user sends "
"or receives data via the stdin, stderr and stdout file objects, dead "
"locks are common and documented [4]_ [5]_.  While communicate can be used"
" to alleviate some of the buffering issues, it will still cause the "
"parent process to block while attempting to read data when none is "
"available to be read from the child process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:54
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:56
msgid ""
"There is a documented need for asynchronous, non-blocking functionality "
"in ``subprocess.Popen`` [6]_ [7]_ [2]_ [3]_.  Inclusion of the code would"
" improve the utility of the Python standard library that can be used on "
"Unix based and Windows builds of Python.  Practically every I/O object in"
" Python has a file-like wrapper of some sort.  Sockets already act as "
"such and for strings there is ``StringIO``.  Popen can be made to act "
"like a file by simply using the methods attached to the "
"``subprocess.Popen.stderr``, stdout and stdin file-like objects.  But "
"when using the read and write methods of those options, you do not have "
"the benefit of asynchronous I/O.  In the proposed solution the wrapper "
"wraps the asynchronous methods to mimic a file object."

msgid "Reference Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:72
msgid ""
"I have been maintaining a Google Code repository that contains all of my "
"changes including tests and documentation [9]_ as well as blog detailing "
"the problems I have come across in the development process [10]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:76
msgid ""
"I have been working on implementing non-blocking asynchronous I/O in the "
"``subprocess`` module as well as a wrapper class for ``subprocess.Popen``"
" that makes it so that an executed process can take the place of a file "
"by duplicating all of the methods and attributes that file objects have."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:81
msgid ""
"There are two base functions that have been added to the "
"``subprocess.Popen`` class: ``Popen.send`` and ``Popen._recv``, each with"
" two separate implementations, one for Windows and one for Unix-based "
"systems.  The Windows implementation uses ctypes to access the functions "
"needed to control pipes in the kernel 32 DLL in an asynchronous manner.  "
"On Unix based systems, the Python interface for file control serves the "
"same purpose.  The different implementations of ``Popen.send`` and "
"``Popen._recv`` have identical arguments to make code that uses these "
"functions work across multiple platforms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:91
msgid ""
"When calling the ``Popen._recv`` function, it requires the pipe name be "
"passed as an argument so there exists the ``Popen.recv`` function that "
"passes selects stdout as the pipe for ``Popen._recv`` by default. "
"``Popen.recv_err`` selects stderr as the pipe by default. ``Popen.recv`` "
"and ``Popen.recv_err`` are much easier to read and understand than "
"``Popen._recv('stdout' ...)`` and ``Popen._recv('stderr' ...)`` "
"respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:98
msgid ""
"Since the ``Popen._recv`` function does not wait on data to be produced "
"before returning a value, it may return empty bytes. ``Popen.asyncread`` "
"handles this issue by returning all data read over a given time interval."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3145.txt:103
msgid ""
"The ``ProcessIOWrapper`` class uses the ``asyncread`` and ``asyncwrite`` "
"functions to allow a process to act like a file so that there are no "
"blocking issues that can arise from using the stdout and stdin file "
"objects produced from a ``subprocess.Popen`` call."

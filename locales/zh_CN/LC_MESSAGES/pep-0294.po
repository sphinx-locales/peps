"A centralized repository of type names was a mistake.  Neither the "
"\"types\" nor \"new\" modules should be carried forward to Python 3.0."

"In the meantime, it does not make sense to make the proposed updates to "
"the modules.  This would cause disruption without any compensating "
"benefit."

#: ../../pep-0294.txt:43
msgid ""
"Instead, the problem that some internal types (frames, functions, etc.) "
"don't live anywhere outside those modules may be addressed by either "
"adding them to ``__builtin__`` or sys.  This will provide a smoother "
"transition to Python 3.0."

msgid "Rationale"

#: ../../pep-0294.txt:52
msgid "Using two sets of names for the same objects is redundant and confusing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0294.txt:55
msgid ""
"In Python versions prior to 2.2 the symbols matching many type names were"
" taken by the factory functions for those types.  Now all basic types "
"have been unified with their factory functions and therefore the type "
"names are available to be consistently used to refer to the type object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0294.txt:61
msgid ""
"Most types are accessible as either builtins or in the new module but "
"some types such as traceback and generator are only accessible through "
"the types module under names which do not match the type name.  This PEP "
"provides a uniform way to access all basic types under a single set of "
"names."

"Because of their widespread use it is not planned to actually remove the "

"The process of including a new package into the Python standard library "
"is hindered by the API lock-in and promise of backward compatibility "
"implied by a package being formally part of Python.  This PEP describes a"
" methodology for marking a standard library package \"provisional\" for "
"the period of a single feature release.  A provisional package may have "
"its API modified prior to \"graduating\" into a \"stable\" state.  On one"
" hand, this state provides the package with the benefits of being "
"formally part of the Python distribution. On the other hand, the core "
"development team explicitly states that no promises are made with regards"
" to the stability of the package's API, which may change for the next "
"release.  While it is considered an unlikely outcome, such packages may "
"even be removed from the standard library without a deprecation period if"
" the concerns regarding their API or maintenance prove well-founded."

"Whenever the Python core development team decides that a new package "

"In the next feature release, the package may either be \"graduated\" into"
" a normal \"stable\" state in the standard library, remain in provisional"
" state, or be rejected and removed entirely from the Python source tree."
"  If the package ends up graduating into the stable state after being "
"provisional, its API may be changed according to accumulated feedback.  "
"The core development team explicitly makes no guarantees about API "
"stability and backward compatibility of provisional packages."

"A provisional package is one which has been deliberately excluded from "
"the standard library's backwards compatibility guarantees.  While major "
"changes to such packages are not expected, as long as they are marked "
"provisional, backwards incompatible changes (up to and including removal "

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:89
msgid ""
"We expect most packages proposed for addition into the Python standard "
"library to go through a feature release in the provisional state. There "
"may, however, be some exceptions, such as packages that use a pre-defined"
" API (for example ``lzma``, which generally follows the API of the "
"existing ``bz2`` package), or packages with an API that has wide "
"acceptance in the Python development community."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:96
msgid ""
"In any case, packages that are proposed to be added to the standard "
"library, whether via the provisional state or directly, must fulfill the "

msgid "Criteria for \"graduation\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:103
msgid ""
"In principle, most provisional packages should eventually graduate to the"
" stable standard library.  Some reasons for not graduating are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:106
msgid ""
"The package may prove to be unstable or fragile, without sufficient "
"developer support to maintain it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:108

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:110
msgid ""
"Essentially, the decision will be made by the core developers on a per-"
"case basis.  The point to emphasize here is that a package's inclusion in"
" the standard library as \"provisional\" in some release does not "
"guarantee it will continue being part of Python in the next release.  At "
"the same time, the bar for making changes in a provisional package is "
"quite high.  We expect that most of the API of most provisional packages "
"will be unchanged at graduation. Withdrawals are expected to be rare."

msgid "Benefits for the core development team"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:125
msgid ""
"Currently, the core developers are really reluctant to add new interfaces"
" to the standard library.  This is because as soon as they're published "
"in a release, API design mistakes get locked in due to backward "
"compatibility concerns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:130
msgid ""
"By gating all major API additions through some kind of a provisional "
"mechanism for a full release, we get one full release cycle of community "
"feedback before we lock in the APIs with our standard backward "
"compatibility guarantee."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:134
msgid ""
"We can also start integrating provisional packages with the rest of the "
"standard library early, so long as we make it clear to packagers that the"
" provisional packages should not be considered optional.  The only "
"difference between provisional APIs and the rest of the standard library "
"is that provisional APIs are explicitly exempted from the usual backward "
"compatibility guarantees."

"For future end users, the broadest benefit lies in a better \"out-of-the-"
"box\" experience - rather than being told \"oh, the standard library "
"tools for task X are horrible, download this 3rd party library instead\","
" those superior tools are more likely to be just be an import away."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0411.txt:148
msgid ""
"For environments where developers are required to conduct due diligence "
"on their upstream dependencies (severely harming the cost-effectiveness "
"of, or even ruling out entirely, much of the material on PyPI), the key "
"benefit lies in ensuring that all packages in the provisional state are "
"clearly under python-dev's aegis from at least the following "

"Using subdomains like \"es.docs.python.org\" or \"docs.es.python.org\" is"

"br.doc.python.org` is uncommon and SEOMoz [23]_ correlated the presence "
"of hyphens as a negative factor.  Usage of underscores in subdomain is "
"prohibited by the RFC1123 [24]_, section 2.1.  Finally, using subdomains "
"means creating TLS certificates for each language. This not only requires"
" more maintenance but will also cause issues in language switcher if, as "
"for version switcher, we want a preflight to check if the translation "

"Using content negotiation (HTTP headers ``Accept-Language`` in the "

"determining the language via another way, like a specific URL, that is "

"languages?\".  As versions exist in any case and translations for a given"
" version may or may not exist, we may prefer \"docs.python.org/3.6/de/\","

"clearer, meaning: \"everything under /de/ is written in German\".  Having"

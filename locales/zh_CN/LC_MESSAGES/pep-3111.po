"Input and output are core features of computer programs.  Currently, "
"Python provides a simple means of output through the print keyword and "
"two simple means of interactive input through the input() and raw_input()"
" built-in functions."

"Python 3.0 will introduce various incompatible changes with previous "
"Python versions\\ [1]_.  Among the proposed changes, print will become a "
"built-in function, print(), while input() and raw_input() would be "
"removed completely from the built-in namespace, requiring importing some "
"module to provide even the most basic input capability."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:37
msgid ""
"With its easy readability and its support for many programming styles "
"(e.g. procedural, object-oriented, etc.) among others, Python is perhaps "
"the best computer language to use in introductory programming classes. "
"Simple programs often need to provide information to the user (output) "
"and to obtain information from the user (interactive input). Any computer"
" language intended to be used in an educational setting should provide "
"straightforward methods for both output and interactive input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:45
msgid ""
"The current proposals for Python 3.0 [1]_ include a simple output pathway"
" via a built-in function named print(), but a more complicated method for"
" input [e.g. via sys.stdin.readline()], one that requires importing an "
"external module.  Current versions of Python (pre-3.0) include "
"raw_input() as a built-in function.  With the availability of such a "
"function, programs that require simple input/output can be written from "
"day one, without requiring discussions of importing modules, streams, "
"etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:55
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:57
msgid ""
"Current built-in functions, like input() and raw_input(), are found to be"
" extremely useful in traditional teaching settings. (For more details, "
"see [2]_ and the discussion that followed.) While the BDFL has clearly "
"stated [3]_ that input() was not to be kept in Python 3000, he has also "
"stated that he was not against revising the decision of killing "
"raw_input()."

"raw_input() provides a simple mean to ask a question and obtain a "
"response from a user.  The proposed plans for Python 3.0 would require "
"the replacement of the single statement::"

"However, from the point of view of many Python beginners and educators, "
"the use of sys.stdin.readline() presents the following problems:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:79
msgid ""
"1. Compared to the name \"raw_input\", the name \"sys.stdin.readline()\" "
"is clunky and inelegant."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:82
msgid ""
"2. The names \"sys\" and \"stdin\" have no meaning for most beginners, "
"who are mainly interested in *what* the function does, and not *where* in"
" the package structure it is located.  The lack of meaning also makes it "
"difficult to remember: is it \"sys.stdin.readline()\", or \" "
"stdin.sys.readline()\"? To a programming novice, there is not any obvious"
" reason to prefer one over the other. In contrast, functions simple and "
"direct names like print, input, and raw_input, and open are easier to "
"remember."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:91
msgid ""
"3. The use of \".\" notation is unmotivated and confusing to many "
"beginners. For example, it may lead some beginners to think \".\"  is a "
"standard character that could be used in any identifier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:95

"4. There is an asymmetry with the print function: why is print not called"
" sys.stdout.print()?"

msgid "Naming Discussion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:111
msgid ""
"With ``input()`` effectively removed from the language, the name "

"considered.  The various possibilities mentioned in various forums "
"include::"

#: ../../pep-3111.txt:124
msgid ""
"While it was initially rejected by the BDFL, it has been suggested that "
"the most direct solution would be to rename \"raw_input\" to \"input\" in"
" Python 3000. The main objection is that Python 2.x already has a "
"function named \"input\", and, even though it is not going to be included"
" in Python 3000, having a built-in function with the same name but "
"different semantics may confuse programmers migrating from 2.x to 3000.  "
"Certainly, this is no problem for beginners, and the scope of the problem"
" is unclear for more experienced programmers, since raw_input(), while "
"popular with many, is not in universal use.  In this instance, the good "
"it does for beginners could be seen to outweigh the harm it does to "
"experienced programmers - although it could cause confusion for people "
"reading older books or tutorials."

"In 2011, the majority of distributions aliased the ``python`` command to "
"Python 2, but some started switching it to Python 3 ([5]_). As some of "
"the former distributions did not provide a ``python2`` command by "
"default, there was previously no way for Python 2 code (or any code that "
"invokes the Python 2 interpreter directly rather than via "
"``sys.executable``) to reliably run on all Unix-like systems without "
"modification, as the ``python`` command would invoke the wrong "
"interpreter version on some systems, and the ``python2`` command would "
"fail completely on others. This PEP originally provided a very simple "
"mechanism to restore cross-platform support, with minimal additional work"
" required on the part of distribution maintainers. Simplified, the "
"recommendation was:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:168
msgid ""
"The ``python`` command was preferred for code compatible with both Python"
" 2 and 3 (since it was available on all systems, even those that already "
"aliased it to Python 3)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:171
msgid ""
"The ``python`` command should always invoke Python 2 (to prevent hard-to-"
"diagnose errors when Python 2 code is run on Python 3)."

"The ``python2`` and ``python3`` commands should be available to specify "
"the version explicitly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:176
msgid ""
"However, these recommendations implicitly assumed that Python 2 would "
"always be available. As Python 2 is nearing its end of life in 2020 (PEP "
"373, PEP 404), distributions are making Python 2 optional or removing it "
"entirely. This means either removing the ``python`` command or switching "
"it to invoke Python 3. Some distributors also decided that their users "
"were better served by ignoring the PEP's original recommendations, and "
"provided system administrators with the freedom to configure their "
"systems based on the needs of their particular environment."

"This section does not contain any official recommendations from the core "

"system. They will hopefully be helpful to any distributions considering "
"making such a change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:217

"The main barrier to a distribution switching the ``python`` command from "
"``python2`` to ``python3`` isn't breakage within the distribution, but "
"instead breakage of private third party scripts developed by sysadmins "
"and other users. Updating the ``python`` command to invoke ``python3`` by"
" default indicates that a distribution is willing to break such scripts "
"with errors that are potentially quite confusing for users that aren't "
"familiar with the backwards incompatible changes in Python 3. For "
"example, while the change of ``print`` from a statement to a builtin "
"function is relatively simple for automated converters to handle, the "
"SyntaxError from attempting to use the Python 2 notation in Python 3 may "
"be confusing for users that are not aware of the change::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:235
msgid ""
"While this might be obvious for experienced Pythonistas, such scripts "
"might even be run by people who are not familiar with Python at all. "
"Avoiding breakage of such third party scripts was the key reason this PEP"
" used to recommend that ``python`` continue to refer to ``python2``."

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:239

"actionable, even for people unfamiliar with Python."

msgid ""
"The ``pythonX.X`` (e.g. ``python3.6``) commands exist on modern systems, "
"on which they invoke specific minor versions of the Python interpreter. "
"It can be useful for distribution-specific packages to take advantage of "
"these utilities if they exist, since it will prevent code breakage if the"
" default minor version of a given major version is changed. However, "
"scripts intending to be cross-platform should not rely on the presence of"
" these utilities, but rather should be tested on several recent minor "
"versions of the target major version, compensating, if necessary, for the"
" small differences that exist between minor versions. This prevents the "
"need for sysadmins to install many very similar versions of the "
"interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:251
msgid ""
"When the ``pythonX.X`` binaries are provided by a distribution, the "
"``python2`` and ``python3`` commands should refer to one of those files "
"rather than being provided as a separate binary file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:254
msgid ""
"It is strongly encouraged that distribution-specific packages use "
"``python3`` (or ``python2``) rather than ``python``, even in code that is"
" not intended to operate on other distributions. This will reduce "
"problems if the distribution later decides to change the version of the "
"Python interpreter that the ``python`` command invokes, or if a sysadmin "
"installs a custom ``python`` command with a different major version than "
"the distribution default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:261
msgid ""
"If the above point is adhered to and sysadmins are permitted to change "
"the ``python`` command, then the ``python`` command should always be "
"implemented as a link to the interpreter binary (or a link to a link) and"
" not vice versa. That way, if a sysadmin does decide to replace the "
"installed ``python`` file, they can do so without inadvertently deleting "
"the previously installed binary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:267
msgid ""
"Even as the Python 2 interpreter becomes less common, it remains "
"reasonable for scripts to continue to use the ``python3`` convention, "
"rather than just ``python``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0394.txt:270
msgid ""
"If these conventions are adhered to, it will become the case that the "
"``python`` command is only executed in an interactive manner as a user "

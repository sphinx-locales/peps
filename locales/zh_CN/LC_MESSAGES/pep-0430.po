"This PEP proposes a strategy for migrating the default version of the "

"It proposes a backwards compatible scheme that preserves the meaning of "
"existing deep links in to the Python 2 documentation, while still "

"Python 2 and 3 documentation in a way that avoids making the Python 3 "
"documentation look like a second-class citizen."

#: ../../pep-0430.txt:30
msgid ""
"With the transition of the overall Python ecosystem from Python 2 to "
"Python 3 still in progress, one question which arises periodically [1_, "
"2_] is when and how to handle the change from providing the Python 2 "
"documentation as the default version displayed at the docs.python.org "
"root URL to providing the Python 3 documentation."

#: ../../pep-0430.txt:51
msgid ""
"Importantly, even when the online documentation is updated, the \"version"

"While deep links in to the python.org documentation may occasionally "
"break within the Python 2 series, this is very rare."

#: ../../pep-0430.txt:58
msgid ""
"Migrating to Python 3 is a very different matter. Many links would break "
"due to renames and removals, and the \"version added\" and \"version "

"This PEP (based on an idea originally put forward back in May [3_]) is to"

msgid ""

"Most importantly, because this scheme doesn't alter the behaviour of any "
"existing deep links, it could be implemented with a significantly shorter"
" warning period than would be required for a scheme that risked breaking "
"deep links, or started to redirect unqualified links to Python 3. The "

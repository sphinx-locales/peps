"This PEP proposes extended usages of the ``*`` iterable unpacking "
"operator and ``**`` dictionary unpacking operators to allow unpacking in "
"more positions, an arbitrary number of times, and in additional "
"circumstances.  Specifically, in function calls, in comprehensions and "
"generator expressions, and in displays."

"Function calls are proposed to support an arbitrary number of unpackings "
"rather than just one::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:33

"Unpacking is proposed to be allowed inside tuple, list, set, and "
"dictionary displays::"

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:59
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:61
msgid ""
"Current usage of the ``*`` iterable unpacking operator features "
"unnecessary restrictions that can harm readability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:64
msgid ""
"Unpacking multiple times has an obvious rationale.  When you want to "
"unpack several iterables into a function definition or follow an unpack "
"with more positional arguments, the most natural way would be to write::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:72
msgid ""
"Simple examples where this is useful are ``print`` and ``str.format``. "
"Instead, you could be forced to write::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:83
msgid "or, if you know to do so::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:91
msgid ""
"which add unnecessary line-noise and, with the first methods, causes "
"duplication of work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:95
msgid ""
"There are two primary rationales for unpacking inside of containers. "
"Firstly there is a symmetry of assignment, where ``fst, *other, lst = "
"elems`` and ``elems = fst, *other, lst`` are approximate inverses, "
"ignoring the specifics of types.  This, in effect, simplifies the "
"language by removing special cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:101
msgid ""
"Secondly, it vastly simplifies types of \"addition\" such as combining "
"dictionaries, and does so in an unambiguous and well-defined way::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:106
msgid "instead of::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:111
msgid ""
"which is especially important in contexts where expressions are "
"preferred.  This is also useful as a more readable way of summing "
"iterables into a list, such as ``my_list + list(my_tuple) + "
"list(my_range)`` which is now equivalent to just ``[*my_list, *my_tuple, "
"*my_range]``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:119
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:121
msgid ""
"Function calls may accept an unbounded number of ``*`` and ``**`` "
"unpackings.  There will be no restriction of the order of positional "
"arguments with relation to ``*`` unpackings nor any restriction of the "
"order of keyword arguments with relation to ``**`` unpackings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:126
msgid ""
"Function calls continue to have the restriction that keyword arguments "
"must follow positional arguments and ``**`` unpackings must additionally "
"follow ``*`` unpackings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:130
msgid ""
"Currently, if an argument is given multiple times — such as a positional "
"argument given both positionally and by keyword — a ``TypeError`` is "
"raised.  This remains true for duplicate arguments provided through "
"multiple ``**`` unpackings, e.g. ``f(**{'x': 2}, **{'x': 3})``, except "
"that the error will be detected at runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:137
msgid "A function looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:145
msgid ""
"Tuples, lists, sets and dictionaries will allow unpacking.  This will act"
" as if the elements from unpacked items were inserted in order at the "
"site of unpacking, much as happens in unpacking in a function-call. "
"Dictionaries require ``**`` unpacking; all the others require ``*`` "
"unpacking."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:150
msgid ""
"The keys in a dictionary remain in a right-to-left priority order, so "
"``{**{'a': 1}, 'a': 2, **{'a': 3}}`` evaluates to ``{'a': 3}``.  There is"
" no restriction on the number or position of unpackings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:156
msgid "Disadvantages"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:158
msgid ""
"The allowable orders for arguments in a function call are more "
"complicated than before.  The simplest explanation for the rules may be "
"\"positional arguments precede keyword arguments and ``**`` unpacking; "
"``*`` unpacking precedes ``**`` unpacking\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:163
msgid ""
"Whilst ``*elements, = iterable`` causes ``elements`` to be a list, "
"``elements = *iterable,`` causes ``elements`` to be a tuple.  The reason "
"for this may confuse people unfamiliar with the construct."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:167
msgid ""
"Concerns have been raised about the unexpected difference between "
"duplicate keys in dictionaries being allowed but duplicate keys in "
"function call syntax raising an error.  Although this is already the case"
" with current syntax, this proposal might exacerbate the issue.  It "
"remains to be seen how much of an issue this is in practice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:175
msgid "Variations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:177
msgid ""
"The PEP originally considered whether the ordering of argument types in a"
" function call (positional, keyword, ``*`` or ``**``) could become less "
"strict. This met little support so the idea was shelved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:181
msgid ""
"Earlier iterations of this PEP allowed unpacking operators inside list, "
"set, and dictionary comprehensions as a flattening operator over "
"iterables of containers::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:192
msgid ""
"This was met with a mix of strong concerns about readability and mild "
"support. In order not to disadvantage the less controversial aspects of "
"the PEP, this was not accepted with the rest of the proposal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:196
msgid ""
"Unbracketed comprehensions in function calls, such as ``f(x for x in "
"it)``, are already valid.  These could be extended to::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0448.txt:202
msgid ""
"However, it wasn't clear if this was the best behaviour or if it should "
"unpack into the arguments of the call to `f`. Since this is likely to be "
"confusing and is of only very marginal utility, it is not included in "
"this PEP.  Instead, these will throw a ``SyntaxError`` and comprehensions"
" with explicit brackets should be used instead."

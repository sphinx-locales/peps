msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:22

"This PEP proposes strategies to enhance Python's performance with respect"
" to handling switching on a single variable having one of multiple "
"possible values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Problem"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:29
msgid ""
"Up to Python 2.5, the typical way of writing multi-value switches has "
"been to use long switch constructs of the following type::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:44
msgid ""
"This works fine for short switch constructs, since the overhead of "
"repeated loading of a local (the variable x in this case) and comparing "
"it to some constant is low (it has a complexity of O(n) on average). "
"However, when using such a construct to write a state machine such as is "
"needed for writing parsers the number of possible states can easily reach"
" 10 or more cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:51
msgid ""
"The current solution to this problem lies in using a dispatch table to "
"find the case implementing method to execute depending on the value of "
"the switch variable (this can be tuned to have a complexity of O(1) on "
"average, e.g. by using perfect hash tables). This works well for state "
"machines which require complex and lengthy processing in the different "
"case methods. It does not perform well for ones which only process one or"
" two instructions per case, e.g."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:65
msgid ""
"A nice example of this is the state machine implemented in pickle.py "
"which is used to serialize Python objects. Other prominent cases include "
"XML SAX parsers and Internet protocol handlers."

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:73
msgid "This PEP proposes two different but not necessarily conflicting solutions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:76
msgid ""
"Adding an optimization to the Python compiler and VM which detects the "
"above if-elif-else construct and generates special opcodes for it which "
"use a read-only dictionary for storing jump offsets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding new syntax to Python which mimics the C style switch statement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:84
msgid ""
"The first solution has the benefit of not relying on adding new keywords "
"to the language, while the second looks cleaner. Both involve some run-"
"time overhead to assure that the switching variable is immutable and "
"hashable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:89
msgid ""
"Both solutions use a dictionary lookup to find the right jump location, "
"so they both share the same problem space in terms of requiring that both"
" the switch variable and the constants need to be compatible to the "
"dictionary implementation (hashable, comparable, a==b => "
"hash(a)==hash(b))."

"It should be possible for the compiler to detect an if-elif-else "
"construct which has the following signature::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:107
msgid ""
"i.e. the left hand side always references the same variable, the right "
"hand side a hashable immutable builtin type.  The right hand sides need "
"not be all of the same type, but they should be comparable to the type of"
" the left hand switch variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:113
msgid ""
"The compiler could then setup a read-only (perfect) hash table, store it "
"in the constants and add an opcode SWITCH in front of the standard if-"
"elif-else byte code stream which triggers the following run-time "
"behaviour:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0275.txt:118
msgid ""
"At runtime, SWITCH would check x for being one of the well-known "
"immutable types (strings, unicode, numbers) and use the hash table for "
"finding the right opcode snippet. If this condition is not met, the "
"interpreter should revert to the standard if-elif-else processing by "
"simply skipping the SWITCH opcode and proceeding with the usual if-elif-"
"else byte code stream."

"The new optimization should not change the current Python semantics (by "
"reducing the number of ``__cmp__`` calls and adding ``__hash__`` calls in"
" if-elif-else constructs which are affected by the optimization). To "
"assure this, switching can only safely be implemented either if a \"from "
"__future__\" style flag is used, or the switching variable is one of the "
"builtin immutable types: int, float, string, unicode, etc. (not subtypes,"

"The switch statement should not implement fall-through behaviour (as does"

"There have been other proposals for the syntax which reuse existing "

"The switch statement could be extended to allow multiple values for one "

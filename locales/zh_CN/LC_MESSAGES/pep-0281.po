"This PEP describes yet another way of exposing the loop counter in for-"

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:41
msgid ""
"It is often desirable to loop over the indices of a sequence.  PEP 212 "
"describes several ways of doing this, including adding a built-in "
"function called indices, conceptually defined as::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:48
msgid ""
"On the assumption that adding functionality to an existing built-in "
"function may be less intrusive than adding a new built-in function, this "
"PEP proposes adding this functionality to the existing functions "
"``range()`` and ``xrange()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:55
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:57
msgid ""
"It is proposed that all three arguments to the built-in functions "
"``range()`` and ``xrange()`` are allowed to be objects with a length "
"(i.e. objects implementing the ``__len__`` method).  If an argument "
"cannot be interpreted as an integer (i.e. it has no ``__int__`` method), "
"its length will be used instead."

msgid "Alternatives"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:85
msgid ""
"A natural alternative to the above specification is allowing ``xrange()``"
" to access its arguments in a lazy manner.  Thus, instead of using their "
"length explicitly, ``xrange`` can return one index for each element of "
"the stop argument until the end is reached.  A similar lazy treatment "
"makes little sense for the start and step arguments since their length "
"must be calculated before iteration can begin.  (Actually, the length of "
"the step argument isn't needed until the second element is returned.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:94
msgid ""
"A pseudo-implementation (using only the stop argument, and assuming that "
"it is iterable) is::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:103
msgid ""
"Testing whether to use ``int()`` or lazy iteration could be done by "
"checking for an ``__iter__`` attribute.  (This example assumes the "
"presence of generators, but could easily have been implemented as a plain"
" iterator object.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:108
msgid ""
"It may be questionable whether this feature is truly useful, since one "
"would not be able to access the elements of the iterable object inside "
"the for loop through indexing."

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:118

"A more controversial alternative (to deal with this) would be to let "
"``range()`` behave like the function ``irange()`` of PEP 212 when "
"supplied with a sequence."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backwards Compatibility"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0281.txt:133
msgid ""
"The proposal could cause backwards incompatibilities if arguments are "
"used which implement both ``__int__`` and ``__len__`` (or ``__iter__`` in"
" the case of lazy iteration with ``xrange``).  The author does not "
"believe that this is a significant problem."

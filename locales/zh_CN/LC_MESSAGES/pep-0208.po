"Many Python types implement numeric operations.  When the arguments of a "
"numeric operation are of different types, the interpreter tries to coerce"
" the arguments into a common type.  The numeric operation is then "
"performed using this common type.  This PEP proposes a new type flag to "
"indicate that arguments to a type's numeric operations should not be "
"coerced.  Operations that do not support the supplied types indicate it "
"by returning a new singleton object.  Types which do not set the type "
"flag are handled in a backwards compatible manner. Allowing operations "
"handle different types is often simpler, more flexible, and faster than "
"having the interpreter do coercion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:30
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:32
msgid ""
"When implementing numeric or other related operations, it is often "
"desirable to provide not only operations between operands of one type "
"only, e.g. integer + integer, but to generalize the idea behind the "
"operation to other type combinations as well, e.g. integer + float."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:37
msgid ""
"A common approach to this mixed type situation is to provide a method of "
"\"lifting\" the operands to a common type (coercion) and then use that "
"type's operand method as execution mechanism.  Yet, this strategy has a "
"few drawbacks:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:42
msgid ""
"the \"lifting\" process creates at least one new (temporary) operand "
"object,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:45
msgid ""
"since the coercion method is not being told about the operation that is "
"to follow, it is not possible to implement operation specific coercion of"
" types,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:49
msgid ""
"there is no elegant way to solve situations were a common type is not at "
"hand, and"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:52
msgid ""
"the coercion method will always have to be called prior to the "
"operation's method itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:55
msgid ""
"A fix for this situation is obviously needed, since these drawbacks make "
"implementations of types needing these features very cumbersome, if not "
"impossible.  As an example, have a look at the ``DateTime`` and "
"``DateTimeDelta`` [1]_ types, the first being absolute, the second "
"relative.  You can always add a relative value to an absolute one, giving"
" a new absolute value.  Yet, there is no common type which the existing "
"coercion mechanism could use to implement that operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:63
msgid ""
"Currently, ``PyInstance`` types are treated specially by the interpreter "
"in that their numeric methods are passed arguments of different types. "
"Removing this special case simplifies the interpreter and allows other "
"types to implement numeric methods that behave like instance types. This "
"is especially useful for extension types like ExtensionClass."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:71
msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:73
msgid ""
"Instead of using a central coercion method, the process of handling "
"different operand types is simply left to the operation.  If the "
"operation finds that it cannot handle the given operand type combination,"
" it may return a special singleton as indicator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:78
msgid ""
"Note that \"numbers\" (anything that implements the number protocol, or "
"part of it) written in Python already use the first part of this strategy"
" - it is the C level API that we focus on here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:82
msgid ""
"To maintain nearly 100% backward compatibility we have to be very careful"
" to make numbers that don't know anything about the new strategy (old "
"style numbers) work just as well as those that expect the new scheme (new"
" style numbers).  Furthermore, binary compatibility is a must, meaning "
"that the interpreter may only access and use new style operations if the "
"number indicates the availability of these."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:89
msgid ""
"A new style number is considered by the interpreter as such if and only "
"if it sets the type flag ``Py_TPFLAGS_CHECKTYPES``.  The main difference "
"between an old style number and a new style one is that the numeric slot "
"functions can no longer assume to be passed arguments of identical type."
"  New style slots must check all arguments for proper type and implement "
"the necessary conversions themselves.  This may seem to cause more work "
"on the behalf of the type implementor, but is in fact no more difficult "
"than writing the same kind of routines for an old style coercion slot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:99
msgid ""
"If a new style slot finds that it cannot handle the passed argument type "
"combination, it may return a new reference of the special singleton "
"``Py_NotImplemented`` to the caller.  This will cause the caller to try "
"the other operands operation slots until it finds a slot that does "
"implement the operation for the specific type combination.  If none of "
"the possible slots succeed, it raises a ``TypeError``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0208.txt:106
msgid ""
"To make the implementation easy to understand (the whole topic is "
"esoteric enough), a new layer in the handling of numeric operations is "
"introduced.  This layer takes care of all the different cases that need "
"to be taken into account when dealing with all the possible combinations "
"of old and new style numbers.  It is implemented by the two static "
"functions ``binary_op()`` and ``ternary_op()``, which are both internal "
"functions that only the functions in Objects/abstract.c have access to.  "
"The numeric API (``PyNumber_*``) is easy to adapt to this new layer."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:48
msgid ""
"In the domain of object-oriented programming, the usage patterns for "
"interacting with an object can be divided into two basic categories, "
"which are 'invocation' and 'inspection'."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:52
msgid ""
"Invocation means interacting with an object by invoking its methods. "
"Usually this is combined with polymorphism, so that invoking a given "
"method may run different code depending on the type of an object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:56
msgid ""
"Inspection means the ability for external code (outside of the object's "
"methods) to examine the type or properties of that object, and make "
"decisions on how to treat that object based on that information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:61
msgid ""
"Both usage patterns serve the same general end, which is to be able to "
"support the processing of diverse and potentially novel objects in a "
"uniform way, but at the same time allowing processing decisions to be "
"customized for each different type of object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:66
msgid ""
"In classical OOP theory, invocation is the preferred usage pattern, and "
"inspection is actively discouraged, being considered a relic of an "
"earlier, procedural programming style.  However, in practice this view is"
" simply too dogmatic and inflexible, and leads to a kind of design "
"rigidity that is very much at odds with the dynamic nature of a language "
"like Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:73
msgid ""
"In particular, there is often a need to process objects in a way that "
"wasn't anticipated by the creator of the object class.  It is not always "
"the best solution to build in to every object methods that satisfy the "
"needs of every possible user of that object.  Moreover, there are many "
"powerful dispatch philosophies that are in direct contrast to the classic"
" OOP requirement of behavior being strictly encapsulated within an "
"object, examples being rule or pattern-match driven logic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:82
msgid ""
"On the other hand, one of the criticisms of inspection by classic OOP "
"theorists is the lack of formalisms and the ad hoc nature of what is "
"being inspected.  In a language such as Python, in which almost any "
"aspect of an object can be reflected and directly accessed by external "
"code, there are many different ways to test whether an object conforms to"
" a particular protocol or not.  For example, if asking 'is this object a "
"mutable sequence container?', one can look for a base class of 'list', or"
" one can look for a method named '__getitem__'.  But note that although "
"these tests may seem obvious, neither of them are correct, as one "
"generates false negatives, and the other false positives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:94
msgid ""
"The generally agreed-upon remedy is to standardize the tests, and group "
"them into a formal arrangement.  This is most easily done by associating "
"with each class a set of standard testable properties, either via the "
"inheritance mechanism or some other means.  Each test carries with it a "
"set of promises: it contains a promise about the general behavior of the "
"class, and a promise as to what other class methods will be available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:102
msgid ""
"This PEP proposes a particular strategy for organizing these tests known "
"as Abstract Base Classes, or ABC.  ABCs are simply Python classes that "
"are added into an object's inheritance tree to signal certain features of"
" that object to an external inspector.  Tests are done using "
"``isinstance()``, and the presence of a particular ABC means that the "
"test has passed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:109
msgid ""
"In addition, the ABCs define a minimal set of methods that establish the "
"characteristic behavior of the type.  Code that discriminates objects "
"based on their ABC type can trust that those methods will always be "
"present.  Each of these methods are accompanied by an generalized "
"abstract semantic definition that is described in the documentation for "
"the ABC.  These standard semantic definitions are not enforced, but are "
"strongly recommended."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:117
msgid ""
"Like all other things in Python, these promises are in the nature of a "
"gentlemen's agreement, which in this case means that while the language "
"does enforce some of the promises made in the ABC, it is up to the "
"implementer of the concrete class to insure that the remaining ones are "
"kept."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the development of this PEP and of its companion, PEP 3141, we "
"repeatedly faced the choice between standardizing more, fine-grained ABCs"
" or fewer, coarse-grained ones.  For example, at one stage, PEP 3141 "
"introduced the following stack of base classes used for complex numbers: "
"MonoidUnderPlus, AdditiveGroup, Ring, Field, Complex (each derived from "
"the previous).  And the discussion mentioned several other algebraic "
"categorizations that were left out: Algebraic, Transcendental, and "
"IntegralDomain, and PrincipalIdealDomain.  In earlier versions of the "
"current PEP, we considered the use cases for separate classes like Set, "
"ComposableSet, MutableSet, HashableSet, MutableComposableSet, "
"HashableComposableSet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:154
msgid ""
"The dilemma here is that we'd rather have fewer ABCs, but then what "
"should a user do who needs a less refined ABC?  Consider e.g. the plight "
"of a mathematician who wants to define his own kind of Transcendental "
"numbers, but also wants float and int to be considered Transcendental.  "
"PEP 3141 originally proposed to patch float.__bases__ for that purpose, "
"but there are some good reasons to keep the built-in types immutable (for"
" one, they are shared between all Python interpreters running in the same"
" address space, as is used by mod_python [16]_)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:164
msgid ""
"Another example would be someone who wants to define a generic function "
"(PEP 3124) for any sequence that has an ``append()`` method. The "
"``Sequence`` ABC (see below) doesn't promise the ``append()`` method, "
"while ``MutableSequence`` requires not only ``append()`` but also various"
" other mutating methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:170
msgid ""
"To solve these and similar dilemmas, the next section will propose a "
"metaclass for use with ABCs that will allow us to add an ABC as a "
"\"virtual base class\" (not the same concept as in C++) to any class, "
"including to another ABC.  This allows the standard library to define "
"ABCs ``Sequence`` and ``MutableSequence`` and register these as virtual "
"base classes for built-in types like ``basestring``, ``tuple`` and "
"``list``, so that for example the following conditions are all true::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3119.txt:187
msgid ""
"The primary mechanism proposed here is to allow overloading the built-in "
"functions ``isinstance()`` and ``issubclass()``.  The overloading works "
"as follows: The call ``isinstance(x, C)`` first checks whether "
"``C.__instancecheck__`` exists, and if so, calls "
"``C.__instancecheck__(x)`` instead of its normal implementation. "
"Similarly, the call ``issubclass(D, C)`` first checks whether "
"``C.__subclasscheck__`` exists, and if so, calls "
"``C.__subclasscheck__(D)`` instead of its normal implementation."
msgstr ""

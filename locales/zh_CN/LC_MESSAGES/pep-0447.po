"It is currently not possible to influence how the `super class`_ looks up"

msgid ""
"The current behavior of ``super.__getattribute__`` causes problems for "
"classes that are dynamic proxies for other (non-Python) classes or types,"
" an example of which is `PyObjC`_. PyObjC creates a Python class for "
"every class in the Objective-C runtime, and looks up methods in the "
"Objective-C runtime when they are used. This works fine for normal "
"access, but doesn't work for access with `super`_ objects. Because of "
"this PyObjC currently includes a custom `super`_ that must be used with "
"its classes, as well as completely reimplementing "
"`PyObject_GenericGetAttr`_ for normal attribute access."

"`PyObjC`_ cannot precalculate the contents of the class ``__dict__`` "

"With this proposal both lookup methods no longer peek in the class "
"``__dict__`` but call the special method ``__getdescriptor__``, which is "

"This PEP describes additions to the Python API and specific behaviors for"
" the CPython implementation that make actions taken by the Python runtime"
" visible to auditing tools. Visibility into these actions provides "
"opportunities for test frameworks, logging frameworks, and security tools"
" to monitor and optionally limit actions taken by the runtime."

"This PEP proposes adding two APIs to provide insights into a running "
"Python application: one for arbitrary events, and another specific to the"
" module import system. The APIs are intended to be available in all "
"Python implementations, though the specific messages and values used are "
"unspecified here to allow implementations the freedom to determine how "
"best to provide information to their users. Some examples likely to be "
"used in CPython are provided for explanatory purposes."

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:38
msgid ""
"Python provides access to a wide range of low-level functionality on many"
" common operating systems. While this is incredibly useful for \"write-"
"once, run-anywhere\" scripting, it also makes monitoring of software "
"written in Python difficult. Because Python uses native system APIs "
"directly, existing monitoring tools either suffer from limited context or"
" auditing bypass."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:45
msgid ""
"Limited context occurs when system monitoring can report that an action "
"occurred, but cannot explain the sequence of events leading to it. For "
"example, network monitoring at the OS level may be able to report "
"\"listening started on port 5678\", but may not be able to provide the "
"process ID, command line, parent process, or the local state in the "
"program at the point that triggered the action. Firewall controls to "
"prevent such an action are similarly limited, typically to process names "
"or some global state such as the current user, and in any case rarely "
"provide a useful log file correlated with other application messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:56
msgid ""
"Auditing bypass can occur when the typical system tool used for an action"
" would ordinarily report its use, but accessing the APIs via Python do "
"not trigger this. For example, invoking \"curl\" to make HTTP requests "
"may be specifically monitored in an audited system, but Python's "
"\"urlretrieve\" function is not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:62
msgid ""
"Within a long-running Python application, particularly one that processes"
" user-provided information such as a web app, there is a risk of "
"unexpected behavior. This may be due to bugs in the code, or deliberately"
" induced by a malicious user. In both cases, normal application logging "
"may be bypassed resulting in no indication that anything out of the "
"ordinary has occurred."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:69
msgid ""
"Additionally, and somewhat unique to Python, it is very easy to affect "
"the code that is run in an application by manipulating either the import "
"system's search path or placing files earlier on the path than intended. "
"This is often seen when developers create a script with the same name as "
"the module they intend to use - for example, a ``random.py`` file that "
"attempts to import the standard library ``random`` module."

"malicious behavior (though it enables some new options to do so). See the"

"We propose two API changes to enable this: an Audit Hook and Verified "

"administrators to deploy builds of Python where auditing is always "

"Only CPython is bound to provide the native APIs as described here. Other"

"events are likewise considered implementation specific, but are bound by "
"normal feature compatibility guarantees."

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:104
msgid ""
"In order to observe actions taken by the runtime (on behalf of the "
"caller), an API is required to raise messages from within certain "
"operations. These operations are typically deep within the Python runtime"
" or standard library, such as dynamic code compilation, module imports, "
"DNS resolution, or use of certain modules such as ``ctypes``."

"Hooks are added by calling ``PySys_AddAuditHook()`` from C at any time, "
"including before ``Py_Initialize()``, or by calling "
"``sys.addaudithook()`` from Python code. Hooks cannot be removed or "
"replaced. For CPython, hooks added from C are global, while hooks added "
"from Python are only for the current interpreter. Global hooks are "
"executed before interpreter hooks."

"When events of interest are occurring, code can either call "
"``PySys_Audit()`` from C (while the GIL is held) or ``sys.audit()``. The "
"string argument is the name of the event, and the tuple contains "
"arguments. A given event name should have a fixed schema for arguments, "
"which should be considered a public API (for each x.y version release), "
"and thus should only change between feature releases with updated "
"documentation. To minimize overhead and simplify handling in native code "
"hook implementations, named arguments are not supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:146
msgid ""
"For maximum compatibility, events using the same name as an event in the "
"reference interpreter CPython should make every attempt to use compatible"
" arguments. Including the name or an abbreviation of the implementation "
"in implementation-specific event names will also help prevent collisions."
" For example, a ``pypy.jit_invoked`` event is clearly distinguished from "
"an ``ipy.jit_invoked`` event. Events raised from Python modules should "
"include their module or package name in the event name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:155
msgid ""
"While event names may be arbitrary UTF-8 strings, for consistency across "
"implementations it is recommended to use valid Python dotted names and "
"avoid encoding specific details in the name. For example, an ``import`` "
"event with the module name ``spam`` as an argument is preferable to a "
"``spam module imported`` event with no arguments. Avoid using embedded "
"null characters or you may upset those who implement hooks using C."
msgstr ""

"When an event is audited, each hook is called in the order it was added "
"(as much as is possible), passing the event name and arguments. If any "
"hook returns with an exception set, later hooks are ignored and *in "
"general* the Python runtime should terminate - exceptions from hooks are "
"not intended to be handled or treated as expected occurrences. This "
"allows hook implementations to decide how to respond to any particular "
"event. The typical responses will be to log the event, abort the "
"operation with an exception, or to immediately terminate the process with"
" an operating system exit call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:172
msgid ""
"When an event is audited but no hooks have been set, the ``audit()`` "
"function should impose minimal overhead. Ideally, each argument is a "
"reference to existing data rather than a value calculated just for the "
"auditing call."

"As hooks may be Python objects, they need to be freed during interpreter "

"Most operating systems have a mechanism to distinguish between files that"

"restrictions. These are an important security mechanism for ensuring that"

"The ``io.open_code()`` function is a drop-in replacement for "
"``open(abspath(str(pathlike)), 'rb')``. Its default behaviour is to open "
"a file for raw, binary access. To change the behaviour a new handler "
"should be set. Handler functions only accept ``str`` arguments. The C API"
" ``PyFile_OpenCode`` function assumes UTF-8 encoding. Paths must be "

"path is correctly resolved."

msgid ""
"A custom handler may be set by calling ``PyFile_SetOpenCodeHook()`` from "
"C at any time, including before ``Py_Initialize()``. However, if a hook "
"has already been set then the call will fail. When ``open_code()`` is "
"called with a hook set, the hook will be passed the path and its return "
"value will be returned directly. The returned object should be an open "
"file-like object that supports reading raw bytes. This is explicitly "
"intended to allow a ``BytesIO`` instance if the open handler has already "
"read the entire file into memory."

"All import and execution functionality involving code from a file will be"
" changed to use ``open_code()`` unconditionally. It is important to note "
"that calls to ``compile()``, ``exec()`` and ``eval()`` do not go through "
"this function - an audit hook that includes the code from these calls is "
"the best opportunity to validate code that is read from the file. Given "
"the current decoupling between import and execution in Python, most "
"imported code will go through both ``open_code()`` and the log hook for "
"``compile``, and so care should be taken to avoid repeating verification "
"steps."

"File accesses that are not intentionally planning to execute code are not"
" expected to use this function. This includes loading pickles, XML or "
"YAML files, where code execution is generally considered malicious rather"
" than intentional. These operations should provide their own auditing "
"events, preferably distinguishing between normal functionality (for "
"example, ``Unpickler.load``) and code execution "
"(``Unpickler.find_class``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0578.rst:267
msgid ""
"A few examples: if the file type normally requires an execute bit (on "
"POSIX) or would warn when marked as having been downloaded from the "
"internet (on Windows), it should probably use ``open_code()`` rather than"
" plain ``open()``. Opening ZIP files using the ``ZipFile`` class should "
"use ``open()``, while opening them via ``zipimport`` should use "
"``open_code()`` to signal the correct intent. Code that uses the wrong "
"function for a particular context may bypass the hook, which in CPython "
"and the standard library should be considered a bug. Using a combination "
"of ``open_code`` hooks and auditing hooks is necessary to trace all "
"executed sources in the presence of arbitrary code."

"For example, ``sys.addaudithook()`` and ``sys.audit()`` should exist but "

"example, completely removing the ability to compile strings into bytecode"
" also breaks the ability to import modules from source code, and if it is"
" not completely removed then there are too many ways to get access to "

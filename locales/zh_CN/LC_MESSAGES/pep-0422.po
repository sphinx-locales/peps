"For an already created class ``cls``, the term \"metaclass\" has a clear "

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:46
msgid ""
"*During* class creation, it has another meaning: it is also used to refer"
" to the metaclass hint that may be provided as part of the class "

"one and the same object, there are two situations where that is not the "
"case:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:51
msgid ""
"If the metaclass hint refers to an instance of ``type``, then it is "
"considered as a candidate metaclass along with the metaclasses of all of "

"is found amongst the candidates, then it will be used instead of the one "
"given in the metaclass hint."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:56
msgid ""
"Otherwise, an explicit metaclass hint is assumed to be a factory function"
" and is called directly to create the class object. In this case, the "
"final metaclass will be determined by the factory function definition. In"
" the typical case (where the factory functions just calls ``type``, or, "
"in Python 3.3 or later, ``types.new_class``) the actual metaclass is then"
" determined based on the parent classes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:63
msgid ""
"It is notable that only the actual metaclass is inherited - a factory "
"function used as a metaclass hook sees only the class currently being "
"defined, and is not invoked for any subclasses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:67
msgid ""
"In Python 3, the metaclass hint is provided using the ``metaclass=Meta`` "
"keyword syntax in the class header. This allows the ``__prepare__`` "
"method on the metaclass to be used to create the ``locals()`` namespace "
"used during execution of the class body (for example, specifying the use "
"of ``collections.OrderedDict`` instead of a regular ``dict``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:73
msgid ""
"In Python 2, there was no ``__prepare__`` method (that API was added for "
"Python 3 by PEP 3115). Instead, a class body could set the "
"``__metaclass__`` attribute, and the class creation process would extract"
" that value from the class namespace to use as the metaclass hint. There "
"is `published code`_ that makes use of this feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:79
msgid ""
"Another new feature in Python 3 is the zero-argument form of the "
"``super()`` builtin, introduced by PEP 3135. This feature uses an "
"implicit ``__class__`` reference to the class being defined to replace "
"the \"by name\" references required in Python 2. Just as code invoked "
"during execution of a Python 2 metaclass could not call methods that "
"referenced the class by name (as the name had not yet been bound in the "
"containing scope), similarly, Python 3 metaclasses cannot call methods "
"that rely on the implicit ``__class__`` reference (as it is not populated"
" until after the metaclass has returned control to the class creation "
"machinery)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:89
msgid ""
"Finally, when a class uses a custom metaclass, it can pose additional "
"challenges to the use of multiple inheritance, as a new class cannot "
"inherit from parent classes with unrelated metaclasses. This means that "

"This PEP proposes that a new mechanism to customise class creation be "

"Restores the ability for class namespaces to have some influence on the "
"class creation process (above and beyond populating the namespace "
"itself), but potentially without the full flexibility of the Python 2 "
"style ``__metaclass__`` hook"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:114
msgid ""
"One mechanism that can achieve this goal is to add a new implicit class "
"decoration hook, modelled directly on the existing explicit class "
"decorators, but defined in the class body or in a parent class, rather "
"than being part of the class definition header."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:119

"Specifically, it is proposed that class definitions be able to provide a "
"class initialisation hook as follows::"

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:142
msgid ""
"If present on the created object, this new hook will be called by the "
"class creation machinery *after* the ``__class__`` reference has been "
"initialised. For ``types.new_class()``, it will be called as the last "
"step before returning the created class object. ``__autodecorate__`` is "
"implicitly converted to a class method when the class is created (prior "
"to the hook being invoked)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:149
msgid ""
"Note, that when ``__autodecorate__`` is called, the name of the class is "
"not yet bound to the new class object. As a consequence, the two argument"
" form of ``super()`` cannot be used to call methods (e.g., "
"``super(Example, cls)`` wouldn't work in the example above). However, the"
" zero argument form of ``super()`` works as expected, since the "
"``__class__`` reference is already initialised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:156
msgid ""
"This general proposal is not a new idea (it was first suggested for "
"inclusion in the language definition `more than 10 years ago`_, and a "
"similar mechanism has long been supported by `Zope's ExtensionClass`_), "
"but the situation has changed sufficiently in recent years that the idea "
"is worth reconsidering for inclusion as a native language feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:162
msgid ""
"In addition, the introduction of the metaclass ``__prepare__`` method in "
"PEP 3115 allows a further enhancement that was not possible in Python 2: "
"this PEP also proposes that ``type.__prepare__`` be updated to accept a "
"factory function as a ``namespace`` keyword-only argument. If present, "
"the value provided as the ``namespace`` argument will be called without "
"arguments to create the result of ``type.__prepare__`` instead of using a"
" freshly created dictionary instance. For example, the following will use"
" an ordered dictionary as the class namespace::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:178
msgid ""
"This PEP, along with the existing ability to use  __prepare__ to share a "
"single namespace amongst multiple class objects, highlights a possible "
"issue with the attribute lookup caching: when the underlying mapping is "
"updated by other means, the attribute lookup cache is not invalidated "
"correctly (this is a key part of the reason class ``__dict__`` attributes"
" produce a read-only view of the underlying storage)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0422.txt:185
msgid ""
"Since the optimisation provided by that cache is highly desirable, the "

"Understanding Python's metaclasses requires a deep understanding of the "

"\"instance of type\"."

"One of the big issues that makes library authors reluctant to use "
"metaclasses (even when they would be appropriate) is the risk of "

"By contrast, adding an ``__autodecorate__`` method to an existing type "

"but when that occurs, it is recognised as a bug in the subclass rather "
"than the library author breaching backwards compatibility guarantees. In "

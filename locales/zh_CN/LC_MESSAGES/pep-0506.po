msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:47
msgid ""
"This proposal is motivated by concerns that Python's standard library "
"makes it too easy for developers to inadvertently make serious security "
"errors.  Theo de Raadt, the founder of OpenBSD, contacted Guido van "
"Rossum and expressed some concern [#]_ about the use of MT for generating"
" sensitive information such as passwords, secure tokens, session keys and"
" similar."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:53
msgid ""
"Although the documentation for the ``random`` module explicitly states "
"that the default is not suitable for security purposes [#]_, it is "
"strongly believed that this warning may be missed, ignored or "
"misunderstood by many Python developers.  In particular:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:58
msgid ""
"developers may not have read the documentation and consequently not seen "
"the warning;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:61
msgid ""
"they may not realise that their specific use of the module has security "
"implications; or"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:64
msgid ""
"not realising that there could be a problem, they have copied code (or "
"learned techniques) from websites which don't offer best practises."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:68
msgid ""
"The first [#]_ hit when searching for \"python how to generate "
"passwords\" on Google is a tutorial that uses the default functions from "
"the ``random`` module [#]_.  Although it is not intended for use in web "
"applications, it is likely that similar techniques find themselves used "
"in that situation. The second hit is to a StackOverflow question about "
"generating passwords [#]_.  Most of the answers given, including the "
"accepted one, use the default functions.  When one user warned that the "
"default could be easily compromised, they were told \"I think you worry "
"too much.\" [#]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:77
msgid ""
"This strongly suggests that the existing ``random`` module is an "
"attractive nuisance when it comes to generating (for example) passwords "
"or secure tokens."

"Additional motivation (of a more philosophical bent) can be found in the "
"post which first proposed this idea [#]_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Proposal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:88
msgid ""
"Alternative proposals have focused on the default PRNG in the ``random`` "
"module, with the aim of providing \"secure by default\" cryptographically"
" strong primitives that developers can build upon without thinking about "
"security.  (See Alternatives below.)  This proposes a different approach:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:93
msgid ""
"The standard library already provides cryptographically strong "
"primitives, but many users don't know they exist or when to use them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:96
msgid ""
"Instead of requiring crypto-naive users to write secure code, the "
"standard library should include a set of ready-to-use \"batteries\" for "
"the most common needs, such as generating secure tokens.  This code will "
"both directly satisfy a need (\"How do I generate a password reset "
"token?\"), and act as an example of acceptable practises which developers"
" can learn from [#]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:103
msgid ""
"To do this, this PEP proposes that we add a new module to the standard "
"library, with the suggested name ``secrets``.  This module will contain a"
" set of ready-to-use functions for common activities with security "
"implications, together with some lower-level primitives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:108
msgid ""
"The suggestion is that ``secrets`` becomes the go-to module for dealing "

"The consensus appears to be that there is no need to add a new CSPRNG to "

"Some illustrative implementations have been given by Nick Coghlan [#]_ "

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:211
msgid ""
"Some applications (such as scientific simulations, and replaying "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:215
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0506.txt:223
msgid ""
"Demonstrated attacks against MT are typically against PHP applications. "
"It is believed that PHP's version of MT is a significantly softer target "

"A: The consensus among security professionals is that MT is not safe in "

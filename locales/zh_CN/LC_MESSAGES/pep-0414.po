"Python 2 supports a concept of \"raw\" Unicode literals that don't meet "

"converted to the appropriate Unicode code points when creating the "
"associated Unicode objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:76

"Python 3 has no corresponding concept - the compiler performs *no* "

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:80
msgid ""
"Since such strings are rarely used and would be interpreted differently "
"in Python 3 if permitted, it was decided that leaving them out entirely "

"immediately on Python 3 (with a Syntax Error), rather than potentially "
"producing different output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:86
msgid ""
"To get equivalent behaviour that will run on both Python 2 and Python 3, "
"either an ordinary Unicode literal can be used (with appropriate "

"those that require the use of Unicode escape sequences."

msgid ""
"With the release of a Python 3 compatible version of the Web Services "
"Gateway Interface (WSGI) specification (PEP 3333) for Python 3.2, many "
"parts of the Python web ecosystem have been making a concerted effort to "
"support Python 3 without adversely affecting their existing developer and"

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:122
msgid ""
"One major item of feedback from key developers in those communities, "
"including Chris McDonough (WebOb, Pyramid), Armin Ronacher (Flask, "
"Werkzeug), Jacob Kaplan-Moss (Django) and Kenneth Reitz (``requests``) is"
" that the requirement to change the spelling of *every* Unicode literal "
"in an application (regardless of how that is accomplished) is a key "
"stumbling block for porting efforts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:129
msgid ""
"In particular, unlike many of the other Python 3 changes, it isn't one "
"that framework and library authors can easily handle on behalf of their "
"users. Most of those users couldn't care less about the \"purity\" of the"
" Python language specification, they just want their websites and "
"applications to work as well as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:135

"While it is the Python web community that has been most vocal in "
"highlighting this concern, it is expected that other highly Unicode aware"

"There are many existing Python communities that are prepared to put up "

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:159
msgid ""
"However, since the proposal is for a comparatively small tweak to the "
"language syntax with no semantic changes, it is feasible to support it as"
" a third party import hook. While such an import hook imposes some import"
" time overhead, and requires additional steps from each application that "
"needs it to get the hook in place, it allows applications that target "
"Python 3.2 to use libraries and frameworks that would otherwise only run "
"on Python 3.3+ due to their use of unicode literal prefixes."

msgid ""
"This is indeed one of the key design principles of Python 3. However, one"

"party developers, we should have a solid rationale for doing so."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:191
msgid ""
"In most cases, the rationale for backwards incompatible Python 3 changes "
"are either to improve code correctness (for example, stricter default "
"separation of binary and text data and integer division upgrading to "
"floats when necessary), reduce typical memory usage (for example, "
"increased usage of iterators and views over concrete lists), or to remove"
" distracting nuisances that make Python code harder to read without "
"increasing its expressiveness (for example, the comma based syntax for "
"naming caught exceptions). Changes backed by such reasoning are *not* "
"going to be reverted, regardless of objections from Python 2 developers "
"attempting to make the transition to Python 3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:202
msgid ""
"In many cases, Python 2 offered two ways of doing things for historical "
"reasons. For example, inequality could be tested with both ``!=`` and "
"``<>`` and integer literals could be specified with an optional ``L`` "
"suffix. Such redundancies have been eliminated in Python 3, which reduces"
" the overall size of the language and improves consistency across "
"developers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:208
msgid ""
"In the original Python 3 design (up to and including Python 3.2), the "
"explicit prefix syntax for unicode literals was deemed to fall into this "
"category, as it is completely unnecessary in Python 3. However, the "
"difference between those other cases and unicode literals is that the "
"unicode literal prefix is *not* redundant in Python 2 code: it is a "
"programmatically significant distinction that needs to be preserved in "
"some fashion to avoid losing information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:215
msgid ""
"While porting tools were created to help with the transition (see next "
"section) it still creates an additional burden on heavy users of unicode "
"strings in Python 2, solely so that future developers learning Python 3 "
"don't need to be told \"For historical reasons, string literals may have "
"an optional ``u`` or ``U`` prefix. Never use this yourselves, it's just "
"there to help with porting from an earlier version of the language.\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:222
msgid ""
"Plenty of students learning Python 2 received similar warnings regarding "
"string exceptions without being confused or irreparably stunted in their "
"growth as Python developers. It will be the same with this feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:226
msgid ""
"This point is further reinforced by the fact that Python 3 *still* allows"
" the uppercase variants of the ``B`` and ``R`` prefixes for bytes "
"literals and raw bytes and string literals. If the potential for "
"confusion due to string prefix variants is that significant, where was "
"the outcry asking that these redundant prefixes be removed along with all"
" the other redundancies that were eliminated in Python 3?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:233
msgid ""
"Just as support for string exceptions was eliminated from Python 2 using "
"the normal deprecation process, support for redundant string prefix "
"characters (specifically, ``B``, ``R``, ``u``, ``U``) may eventually be "
"eliminated from Python 3, regardless of the current acceptance of this "
"PEP. However, such a change will likely only occur once third party "
"libraries supporting Python 2.7 is about as common as libraries "
"supporting Python 2.2 or 2.3 is today."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0414.txt:245

"One reason the removal of unicode literals has provoked such concern "
"amongst the web development community is that the updated WSGI "

"This PEP proposes adding the mock [1]_ testing library to the Python "
"standard library as ``unittest.mock``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:23
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:25
msgid ""
"Creating mock objects for testing is a common need in Python. Many "
"developers create ad-hoc mocks, as needed, in their test suites. This is "
"currently what we do in the Python test suite, where a standardised mock "
"object library would be helpful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:30
msgid ""
"There are many mock object libraries available for Python [2]_. Of these,"
" mock is overwhelmingly the most popular, with as many downloads on PyPI "
"as the other mocking libraries combined."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:34
msgid ""
"An advantage of mock is that it is a mocking library and not a framework."
" It provides a configurable and flexible mock object, without being "
"opinionated about how you write your tests. The mock api is now well "
"battle-tested and stable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:39
msgid ""
"mock also handles safely monkeypatching and unmonkeypatching objects "
"during the scope of a test. This is hard to do safely and many developers"
" / projects mimic this functionality (often incorrectly). A standardised "
"way to do this, handling the complexity of patching in the presence of "
"the descriptor protocol (etc) is useful. People are asking for a "
"\"patch\" [3]_ feature to unittest. Doing this via mock.patch is "
"preferable to re-implementing part of this functionality in unittest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:50
msgid "Background"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:52
msgid ""
"Addition of mock to the Python standard library was discussed and agreed "
"to at the Python Language Summit 2012."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open Issues"

msgid ""
"As of release 0.8, which is current at the time of writing, mock is "
"compatible with Python 2.4-3.2. Moving into the Python standard library "
"will allow for the removal of some Python 2 specific \"compatibility "
"hacks\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0417.txt:64
msgid ""
"mock 0.8 introduced a new feature, \"auto-speccing\", obsoletes an older "
"mock feature called \"mocksignature\". The \"mocksignature\" "
"functionality can be removed from mock altogether prior to inclusion."

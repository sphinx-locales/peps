"This PEP proposes adding an enhanced version of the ``pkg_resources`` "
"module to the standard library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:19
msgid ""
"``pkg_resources`` is a module used to find and manage Python "
"package/version dependencies and access bundled files and resources, "
"including those inside of zipped ``.egg`` files.  Currently, "
"``pkg_resources`` is only available through installing the entire "
"``setuptools`` distribution, but it does not depend on any other part of "
"setuptools; in effect, it comprises the entire runtime support library "
"for Python Eggs, and is independently useful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:27
msgid ""
"In addition, with one feature addition, this module could support easy "
"bootstrap installation of several Python package management tools, "
"including ``setuptools``, ``workingenv``, and ``zc.buildout``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:33
msgid "Proposal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:35
msgid ""
"Rather than proposing to include ``setuptools`` in the standard library, "
"this PEP proposes only that ``pkg_resources`` be added to the standard "
"library for Python 2.6 and 3.0.  ``pkg_resources`` is considerably more "
"stable than the rest of setuptools, with virtually no new features being "
"added in the last 12 months."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:41
msgid ""
"However, this PEP also proposes that a new feature be added to "
"``pkg_resources``, before being added to the stdlib.  Specifically, it "
"should be possible to do something like::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:47
msgid ""
"to request downloading and installation of ``SomePackage`` from PyPI. "
"This feature would *not* be a replacement for ``easy_install``; instead, "
"it would rely on ``SomePackage`` having pure-Python ``.egg`` files listed"
" for download via the PyPI XML-RPC API, and the eggs would be placed in "
"the ``$PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`` directory, where they would **not** be "
"importable by default.  (And no scripts would be installed.) However, if "
"the download egg contains installation bootstrap code, it will be given a"
" chance to run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:56
msgid ""
"These restrictions would allow the code to be extremely simple, yet still"
" powerful enough to support users downloading package management tools "
"such as ``setuptools``, ``workingenv`` and ``zc.buildout``, simply by "
"supplying the tool's name on the command line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:63
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:65
msgid ""
"Many users have requested that ``setuptools`` be included in the standard"
" library, to save users needing to go through the awkward process of "
"bootstrapping it.  However, most of the bootstrapping complexity comes "
"from the fact that setuptools-installed code cannot use the "
"``pkg_resources`` runtime module unless setuptools is already installed. "
"Thus, installing setuptools requires (in a sense) that setuptools already"
" be installed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:73
msgid ""
"Other Python package management tools, such as ``workingenv`` and "
"``zc.buildout``, have similar bootstrapping issues, since they both make "
"use of setuptools, but also want to provide users with something "
"approaching a \"one-step install\".  The complexity of creating bootstrap"
" utilities for these and any other such tools that arise in future, is "
"greatly reduced if ``pkg_resources`` is already present, and is also able"
" to download pre-packaged eggs from PyPI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:81
msgid ""
"(It would also mean that setuptools would not need to be installed in "
"order to simply *use* eggs, as opposed to building them.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0365.txt:84
msgid ""
"Finally, in addition to providing access to eggs built via setuptools or "
"other packaging tools, it should be noted that since Python 2.5, the "
"distutils install package metadata (aka ``PKG-INFO``) files that can be "
"read by ``pkg_resources`` to identify what distributions are already on "
"``sys.path``.  In environments where Python packages are installed using "
"system package tools (like RPM), the ``pkg_resources`` module provides an"
" API for detecting what versions of what packages are installed, even if "
"those packages were installed via the distutils instead of setuptools."

"The ``pkg_resources`` implementation is maintained in the Python SVN "
"repository under ``/sandbox/trunk/setuptools/``; see ``pkg_resources.py``"

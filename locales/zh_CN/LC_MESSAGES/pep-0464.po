msgid ""
"This PEP proposes the deprecation and removal of the PyPI Mirror "
"Authenticity API, this includes the /serverkey URL and all of the URLs "
"under /serversig."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:25
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:27
msgid ""
"The PyPI mirroring infrastructure (defined in PEP 381) provides a means "
"to mirror the content of PyPI used by the automatic installers, and as a "
"component of that, it provides a method for verifying the authenticity of"
" the mirrored content."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:32
msgid "This PEP proposes the removal of this API due to:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:34
msgid ""
"There are no known implementations that utilize this API, this includes "
"`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_ and `setuptools "
"<http://pythonhosted.org//setuptools/>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:37
msgid ""
"Because this API uses DSA it is vulnerable to leaking the private key if "
"there is *any* bias in the random nonce."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:39
msgid ""
"This API solves one small corner of the trust problem, however the "
"problem itself is much larger and it would be better to have a fully "
"fledged system, such as `The Update Framework "
"<https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/>`_, instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:44
msgid ""
"Due to the issues it has and the lack of use it is the opinion of this "
"PEP that it does not provide any practical benefit to justify the "
"additional complexity."

msgid "Plan for Deprecation & Removal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:52
msgid ""
"Immediately upon the acceptance of this PEP the Mirror Authenticity API "
"will be considered deprecated and mirroring agents and installation tools"
" should stop accessing it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:56
msgid ""
"Instead of actually removing it from the current code base (PyPI 1.0) the"
" current work to replace PyPI 1.0 with a new code base (PyPI 2.0) will "
"simply not implement this API. This would cause the API to be \"removed\""
" when the switch from 1.0 to 2.0 occurs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:61
msgid ""
"If PyPI 2.0 has not been deployed in place of PyPI 1.0 by Sept 01 2014 "
"then this PEP will be implemented in the PyPI 1.0 code base instead (by "
"removing the associated code)."

#: ../../pep-0464.txt:65
msgid ""
"No changes will be required in the installers, however PEP 381 compliant "
"mirroring clients, such as `bandersnatch "
"<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bandersnatch/>`_ and `pep381client "
"<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep381client/>`_ will need to be updated to"
" no longer attempt to mirror the /serversig URLs."

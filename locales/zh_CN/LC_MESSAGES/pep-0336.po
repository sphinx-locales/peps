"This PEP is rejected.  It is considered a feature that ``None`` raises an"
" error when called.  The proposal falls short in tests for obviousness, "
"clarity, explicitness, and necessity.  The provided Switch example is "
"nice but easily handled by a simple lambda definition. See python-dev "
"discussion on 17 June 2005 [2]_."

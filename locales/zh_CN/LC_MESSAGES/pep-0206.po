msgid "Batteries Included Philosophy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0206.txt:23
msgid ""
"The Python source distribution has long maintained the philosophy of "
"\"batteries included\" -- having a rich and versatile standard library "
"which is immediately available, without making the user download separate"
" packages.  This gives the Python language a head start in many projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0206.txt:29
msgid ""
"However, the standard library modules aren't always the best choices for "
"a job.  Some library modules were quick hacks (e.g. ``calendar``, "
"``commands``), some were designed poorly and are now near-impossible to "
"fix (``cgi``), and some have been rendered obsolete by other, more "
"complete modules (``binascii`` offers the same features as the "
"``binhex``, ``uu``, ``base64`` modules).  This PEP describes a list of "
"third-party modules that make Python more competitive for various "
"application domains, forming the Python Advanced Library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0206.txt:38
msgid ""
"The deliverable is a set of scripts that will retrieve, build, and "
"install the packages for a particular application domain.  The Python "
"Package Index now contains enough information to let software "
"automatically find packages and download them, so the time is ripe to "
"implement this."

#: ../../pep-0206.txt:44
msgid ""
"Currently this document doesn't suggest *removing* modules from the "
"standard library that are superseded by a third-party module. That's "
"difficult to do because it entails many backward-compatibility problems, "
"so it's not worth bothering with now."

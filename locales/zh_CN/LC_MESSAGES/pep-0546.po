msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:36
msgid ""
"While Python 2.7 is getting closer to its end-of-support date (scheduled "
"for 2020), it is still used on production systems and the Python "
"community is still responsible for its security. This PEP will help "
"facilitate the future adoption of :pep:`543` across all supported Python "
"versions, which will improve security for both Python 2 and Python 3 "
"users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:42
msgid ""
"This PEP does NOT propose a general exception for backporting new "
"features to Python 2.7 - every new feature proposed for backporting will "
"still need to be justified independently. In particular, it will need to "
"be explained why relying on an independently updated backport on the "
"Python Package Index instead is not an acceptable solution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:50
msgid "PEP 543"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:52
msgid ""
":pep:`543` defines a new TLS API for Python which would enhance Python "
"security by giving Python applications access to the native TLS "
"implementations on Windows and macOS, instead of using OpenSSL. A side "
"effect is that it gives access to the system trust store and certificates"
" installed locally by system administrators, enabling Python applications"
" to use \"company certificates\" without having to modify each "
"application and so to correctly validate TLS certificates (instead of "
"having to ignore or bypass TLS certificate validation)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:61
msgid ""
"For practical reasons, Cory Benfield would like to first implement an "
"I/O-less class similar to ssl.MemoryBIO and ssl.SSLObject for :pep:`543`,"
" and to provide a second class based on the first one to use sockets or "
"file descriptors.  This design would help to structure the code to "
"support more backends and simplify testing and auditing, as well as "
"implementation. Later, optimized classes using directly sockets or file "
"descriptors may be added for performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:69
msgid ""
"While :pep:`543` defines an API, the PEP would only make sense if it "
"comes with at least one complete and good implementation. The first "
"implementation would ideally be based on the ``ssl`` module of the Python"
" standard library, as this is shipped to all users by default and can be "
"used as a fallback implementation in the absence of anything more "
"targeted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:75
msgid ""
"If this backport is not performed, the only baseline implementation that "
"could be used would be pyOpenSSL. This is problematic, however, because "
"of the interaction with pip, which is shipped with CPython on all "
"supported versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:81
msgid "requests, pip and ensurepip"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:83
msgid ""
"There are plans afoot to look at moving Requests to a more event-loop-y "
"model. The Requests team does not feel at this time it is possible to "
"abandon support for Python 2.7, so doing so would require using either "
"Twisted or Tornado, or writing their own asynchronous abstraction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:88
msgid ""
"For asynchronous code, a MemoryBIO provides substantial advantages over "
"using a wrapped socket. It reduces the amount of buffering that must be "
"done, works on IOCP-based reactors as well as select/poll based ones, and"
" also greatly simplifies the reactor and implementation code. For this "
"reason, Requests is disinclined to use a wrapped-socket-based "
"implementation. In the absence of a backport to Python 2.7, Requests is "
"required to use the same solution that Twisted does: namely, a mandatory "
"dependency on  `pyOpenSSL <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOpenSSL>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:97
msgid ""
"The `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_ program has to embed all its "
"dependencies for practical reasons: namely, that it cannot rely on any "
"other installation method being present. Since pip depends on requests, "
"it means that it would have to embed a copy of pyOpenSSL. That would "
"imply substantial usability pain to install pip. Currently, pip doesn't "
"support embedding C extensions which must be compiled on each platform "
"and so require a C compiler."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:105
msgid ""
"Since Python 2.7.9, Python embeds a copy of pip both for default "
"installation and for use in virtual environments via the new "
"``ensurepip`` module. If pip ends up bundling PyOpenSSL, then CPython "
"will end up bundling PyOpenSSL. Only backporting ``ssl.MemoryBIO`` and "
"``ssl.SSLObject`` would avoid the need to embed pyOpenSSL, and would fix "
"the bootstrap issue (python -> ensurepip -> pip -> requests -> "
"MemoryBIO)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:112
msgid ""
"This situation is less problematic than the barrier to adoption of PEP "
"543, as naturally Requests does not have to move to an event loop model "
"before it drops support for Python 2.7. However, it does make it painful "
"for Requests (and pip) to embrace both asyncio and the ``async`` and "
"``await`` keywords for as long as it continues to support Python 2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:119
msgid "Other Benefits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:121
msgid ""
"Adopting this PEP would have other smaller ecosystem benefits. For "
"example, Twisted would be able to reduce its dependency on third-party C "
"extensions. Additionally, the PyOpenSSL development team would like to "
"sunset the module, and this backport would free them up to do so in a "
"graceful manner without leaving their users in the lurch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:127
msgid ""
"Each of these fringe benefits, while small, also provides value to the "
"wider Python ecosystem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:132
msgid "Concerns"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:134
msgid "There are some concerns that people have about this backport."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:137
msgid "What About Old Python 2?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:139
msgid ""
"A number of the Python 2 users in the world are not keeping pace with "
"Python 2 releases. This is most usually because they are using LTS "
"releases that are not keeping pace with the minor releases of Python 2. "
"These users would not be able to use the MemoryBIO, and so projects "
"concerned with Python 2 compatibility may be unable to rely on the "
"MemoryBIO being present on most of their user's systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:146
msgid ""
"This concern is reasonable. How critical it is depends on the likelihood "
"of current users of Python 2 migrating to Python 3, or just trying to use"
" the most recent Python 2 release. Put another way, at some point "
"libraries will want to drop Python 2 support: the question is only "
"whether a significant majority of their Python 2 users have moved to "
"whatever Python 2 release contains this backport before they do so."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0546.txt:153
msgid ""
"Ultimately, the authors of this PEP believe that the burden of this "
"backport is sufficiently minimal to justify backporting despite this "
"concern. If it turns out that migration to newer 2.7 releases is too "
"slow, then the value of the work will be minimal, but if the migration to"
" newer 2.7 releases is anything like reasonable then there will be "
"substantial value gained."

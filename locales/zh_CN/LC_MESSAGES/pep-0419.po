msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:31
msgid ""
"Python has two nice ways to do cleanup.  One is a ``finally`` statement "
"and the other is a context manager (usually called using a ``with`` "
"statement).  However, neither is protected from interruption by "
"``KeyboardInterrupt`` or ``GeneratorExit`` caused by "
"``generator.throw()``.  For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:45
msgid ""
"If ``KeyboardInterrupt`` occurs just after the second ``print()`` call, "
"the lock will not be released.  Similarly, the following code using the "
"``with`` statement is affected::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:68
msgid ""
"If ``KeyboardInterrupt`` occurs near any of the ``print()`` calls, the "
"lock will never be released."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:73
msgid "Coroutine Use Case"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:75
msgid ""
"A similar case occurs with coroutines.  Usually coroutine libraries want "
"to interrupt the coroutine with a timeout.  The ``generator.throw()`` "
"method works for this use case, but there is no way of knowing if the "
"coroutine is currently suspended from inside a ``finally`` clause."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:81
msgid ""
"An example that uses yield-based coroutines follows.  The code looks "
"similar using any of the popular coroutine libraries Monocle [1]_, "
"Bluelet [2]_, or Twisted [3]_. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:96
msgid ""
"In the example above, ``yield something`` means to pause executing the "
"current coroutine and to execute coroutine ``something`` until it "
"finishes execution.  Therefore, the coroutine library itself needs to "
"maintain a stack of generators.  The ``connection.sendall()`` call waits "
"until the socket is writable and does a similar thing to what "
"``socket.sendall()`` does."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:103
msgid ""
"The ``with`` statement ensures that all code is executed within 5 seconds"
" timeout.  It does so by registering a callback in the main loop, which "
"calls ``generator.throw()`` on the top-most frame in the coroutine stack "
"when a timeout happens."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:108
msgid ""
"The ``greenlets`` extension works in a similar way, except that it "
"doesn't need ``yield`` to enter a new stack frame.  Otherwise "
"considerations are similar."

"A new flag on the frame object is proposed.  It is set to ``True`` if "

"flag must be implemented as a counter of nested finally statements "
"currently being executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:124
msgid ""
"The internal counter also needs to be incremented during execution of the"
" ``SETUP_WITH`` and ``WITH_CLEANUP`` bytecodes, and decremented when "
"execution for these bytecodes is finished.  This allows to also protect "
"``__enter__()`` and ``__exit__()`` methods."

"A new function for the ``sys`` module is proposed.  This function sets a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:148
msgid ""
"``isframeincleanup()``, given a frame or generator object as its sole "

"``getcleanupframe()``, given a frame object as its sole argument, returns"
" the innermost frame which has a true value of ``f_in_cleanup``, or "

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:230
msgid ""
"Sometimes a ``finally`` clause or an ``__enter__()``/``__exit__()`` "
"method can raise an exception.  Usually this is not a problem, since more"
" important exceptions like ``KeyboardInterrupt`` or ``SystemExit`` should"
" be raised instead.  But it may be nice to be able to keep the original "
"exception inside a ``__context__`` attribute.  So the cleanup hook "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:248
msgid ""
"There is no need to have three arguments like in the ``__exit__`` method "
"since there is a ``__traceback__`` attribute in exception in Python 3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:252

"However, this will set the ``__cause__`` for the exception, which is not "

"statement::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0419.txt:281
msgid ""
"However, for coroutines one usually can't use the ``with`` statement "

"We consider ``f_in_cleanup`` an implementation detail.  The actual "

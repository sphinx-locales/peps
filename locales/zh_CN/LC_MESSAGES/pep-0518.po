"This PEP specifies how Python software packages should specify what build"
" dependencies they have in order to execute their chosen build system. As"
" part of this specification, a new configuration file is introduced for "
"software packages to use to specify their build dependencies (with the "
"expectation that the same configuration file will be used for future "

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:34
msgid ""
"When Python first developed its tooling for building distributions of "
"software for projects, distutils [#distutils]_ was the chosen solution. "
"As time went on, setuptools [#setuptools]_ gained popularity to add some "
"features on top of distutils. Both used the concept of a ``setup.py`` "
"file that project maintainers executed to build distributions of their "
"software (as well as users to install said distribution)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:42
msgid ""
"Using an executable file to specify build requirements under distutils "
"isn't an issue as distutils is part of Python's standard library. Having "
"the build tool as part of Python means that a ``setup.py`` has no "
"external dependency that a project maintainer needs to worry about to "
"build a distribution of their project. There was no need to specify any "
"dependency information as the only dependency is Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:49
msgid ""
"But when a project chooses to use setuptools, the use of an executable "
"file like ``setup.py`` becomes an issue. You can't execute a ``setup.py``"
" file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no "
"standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion "
"without executing the ``setup.py`` file where that information is stored."
" It's a catch-22 of a file not being runnable without knowing its own "
"contents which can't be known programmatically unless you run the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:58
msgid ""
"Setuptools tried to solve this with a ``setup_requires`` argument to its "
"``setup()`` function [#setup_args]_. This solution has a number of "
"issues, such as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:62
msgid ""
"No tooling (besides setuptools itself) can access this information "
"without executing the ``setup.py``, but ``setup.py`` can't be executed "
"without having these items installed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:65
msgid ""
"While setuptools itself will install anything listed in this, they won't "
"be installed until *during* the execution of the ``setup()`` function, "
"which means that the only way to actually use anything added here is "
"through increasingly complex machinations that delay the import and usage"
" of these modules until later on in the execution of the ``setup()`` "
"function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:71
msgid ""
"This cannot include ``setuptools`` itself nor can it include a "
"replacement to ``setuptools``, which means that projects such as "
"``numpy.distutils`` are largely incapable of utilizing it and projects "
"cannot take advantage of newer setuptools features until their users "
"naturally upgrade the version of setuptools to a newer one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:77
msgid ""
"The items listed in ``setup_requires`` get implicitly installed whenever "
"you execute the ``setup.py`` but one of the common ways that the "
"``setup.py`` is executed is via another tool, such as ``pip``, who is "
"already managing dependencies. This means that a command like ``pip "
"install spam`` might end up having both pip and setuptools downloading "
"and installing packages and end users needing to configure *both* tools "
"(and for ``setuptools`` without being in control of the invocation) to "
"change settings like which repository it installs from. It also means "
"that users need to be aware of the discovery rules for both tools, as one"
" may support different package formats or determine the latest version "
"differently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:90
msgid ""
"This has culminated in a situation where use of ``setup_requires`` is "
"rare, where projects tend to either simply copy and paste snippets "
"between ``setup.py`` files or they eschew it all together in favor of "
"simply documenting elsewhere what they expect the user to have manually "
"installed prior to attempting to build or install their project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:97
msgid ""
"All of this has led pip [#pip]_ to simply assume that setuptools is "
"necessary when executing a ``setup.py`` file. The problem with this, "
"though, is it doesn't scale if another project began to gain traction in "
"the community as setuptools has. It also prevents other projects from "
"gaining traction due to the friction required to use it with a project "
"when pip can't infer the fact that something other than setuptools is "
"required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0518.txt:105
msgid ""
"This PEP attempts to rectify the situation by specifying a way to list "
"the minimal dependencies of the build system of a project in a "
"declarative fashion in a specific file. This allows a project to list "
"what build dependencies it has to go from e.g. source checkout to wheel, "
"while not falling into the catch-22 trap that a ``setup.py`` has where "
"tooling can't infer what a project needs to build itself. Implementing "
"this PEP will allow projects to specify what build system they depend on "
"upfront so that tools like pip can make sure that they are installed in "

"Two is that YAML itself is not safe by default. The specification allows "
"for the arbitrary execution of code which is best avoided when dealing "
"with configuration data.  It is of course possible to avoid this behavior"
" -- for example, PyYAML provides a ``safe_load`` operation -- but if any "
"tool carelessly uses ``load`` instead then they open themselves up to "
"arbitrary code execution. While this PEP is focused on the building of "

"data such as project name and version number may end up in the same file "
"someday where arbitrary code execution is not desired."

"And finally, the most popular Python implementation of YAML is PyYAML "
"[#pyyaml]_ which is a large project of a few thousand lines of code and "

"necessarily an issue, this becomes more of a problem for projects like "

" as to be fully self-contained (otherwise you end up with your install "

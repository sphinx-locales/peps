"This PEP describes an extension to Python's import mechanism which "
"improves sharing of Python source code files among multiple installed "
"different versions of the Python interpreter.  It does this by allowing "
"more than one byte compilation file (.pyc files) to be co-located with "
"the Python source file (.py file).  The extension described here can also"
" be used to support different Python compilation caches, such as JIT "
"output that may be produced by an Unladen Swallow [1]_ enabled C Python."

msgid "Background"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3147.txt:31
msgid ""
"CPython compiles its source code into \"byte code\", and for performance "
"reasons, it caches this byte code on the file system whenever the source "
"file has changes.  This makes loading of Python modules much faster "
"because the compilation phase can be bypassed.  When your source file is "
"`foo.py`, CPython caches the byte code in a `foo.pyc` file right next to "
"the source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3147.txt:38
msgid ""
"Byte code files contain two 32-bit big-endian numbers followed by the "
"marshaled [2]_ code object.  The 32-bit numbers represent a magic number "
"and a timestamp.  The magic number changes whenever Python changes the "
"byte code format, e.g. by adding new byte codes to its virtual machine.  "
"This ensures that pyc files built for previous versions of the VM won't "
"cause problems.  The timestamp is used to make sure that the pyc file "
"match the py file that was used to create it.  When either the magic "
"number or timestamp do not match, the py file is recompiled and a new pyc"
" file is written."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3147.txt:48
msgid ""
"In practice, it is well known that pyc files are not compatible across "
"Python major releases.  A reading of import.c [3]_ in the Python source "
"code proves that within recent memory, every new CPython major release "
"has bumped the pyc magic number."

msgid ""
"Linux distributions such as Ubuntu [4]_ and Debian [5]_ provide more than"
" one Python version at the same time to their users.  For example, Ubuntu"
" 9.10 Karmic Koala users can install Python 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1, with "
"Python 2.6 being the default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3147.txt:62
msgid ""
"This causes a conflict for third party Python source files installed by "
"the system, because you cannot compile a single Python source file for "
"more than one Python version at a time.  When Python finds a `pyc` file "
"with a non-matching magic number, it falls back to the slower process of "
"recompiling the source.  Thus if your system installed a "
"`/usr/share/python/foo.py`, two different versions of Python would fight "
"over the `pyc` file and rewrite it each time the source is compiled.  "
"(The standard library is unaffected by this, since multiple versions of "
"the stdlib *are* installed on such distributions..)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3147.txt:72
msgid ""
"Furthermore, in order to ease the burden on operating system packagers "
"for these distributions, the distribution packages do not contain Python "
"version numbers [6]_; they are shared across all Python versions "
"installed on the system.  Putting Python version numbers in the packages "
"would be a maintenance nightmare, since all the packages - *and their "
"dependencies* - would have to be updated every time a new Python release "
"was added or removed from the distribution.  Because of the sheer number "
"of packages available, this amount of work is infeasible."

"Because these distributions cannot share pyc files, elaborate mechanisms "
"have been developed to put the resulting pyc files in non-shared "
"locations while the source code is still shared.  Examples include the "
"symlink-based Debian regimes python-support [8]_ and python-central [9]_."
"  These approaches make for much more complicated, fragile, inscrutable, "
"and fragmented policies for delivering Python applications to a wide "
"range of users.  Arguably more users get Python from their operating "
"system vendor than from upstream tarballs.  Thus, solving this pyc "

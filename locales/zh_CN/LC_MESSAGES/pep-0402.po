"When new users come to Python from other languages, they are often "

"In most other languages that have a similar path mechanism to Python's "

msgid ""
"However, the very fact that each distribution of modules for a package "

#: ../../pep-0402.txt:107
msgid ""
"As terminology discussions continued on the Import-SIG, it soon became "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0402.txt:131

"In current versions of Python, however, the module and the package are "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0402.txt:141
msgid ""
"On the negative side, however, it is non-intuitive for beginners, and "

"``Foo/__init__.py``."

"Conversely, if you intend to create a ``Foo.Bar`` module from the start, "

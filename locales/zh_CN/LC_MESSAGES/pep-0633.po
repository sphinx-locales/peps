msgid "Rejection Notice"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:18
msgid ""
"This PEP has been rejected in favour of :pep:`631` due to its popularity,"
" consistency with the existing usage of :pep:`508` strings, and "
"compatibility with existing packaging tool suites."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:24
msgid "Abstract"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:26
msgid ""
"This PEP specifies how to write a project's dependencies in a "
"``pyproject.toml`` file for packaging-related tools to consume using the "
"fields defined in :pep:`621`, as an alternative to the :pep:`508`-based "
"approach defined in :pep:`631`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:33
msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:35
msgid ""
"There are multiple benefits to using TOML tables and other data-types to "
"represent requirements rather than :pep:`508` strings:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:38
msgid "Easy initial validation via the TOML syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:40
msgid "Easy secondary validation using a schema, for example a `JSON Schema`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:42
msgid ""
"Potential for users to guess the keys of given features, rather than "
"memorising a syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:45
msgid ""
"Users of multiple other popular languages may already be familiar with "
"the TOML syntax."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:48
msgid ""
"TOML directly represents the same data structures as in JSON, and "
"therefore a sub-set of Python literals, so users can understand the "
"hierarchy and type of value"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:56
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:58
msgid ""
"Most of this is taken from discussions in the `PEP 621 dependencies "
"topic`_. This has elements from `Pipfile`_, `Poetry`_, `Dart's "
"dependencies`_ and `Rust's Cargo`_. A `comparison document`_ shows "
"advantages and disadvantages between this format and :pep:`508`-style "
"specifiers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:63
msgid ""
"In the specification of multiple requirements with the same distribution "
"name (where environment markers choose the appropriate dependency), the "
"chosen solution is similar to `Poetry`_'s, where an array of requirements"
" is allowed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:67
msgid ""
"The direct-reference keys closely align with and utilise pep:`610` and "
":pep:`440` as to reduce differences in the packaging ecosystem and rely "

msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0633.rst:82
msgid ""

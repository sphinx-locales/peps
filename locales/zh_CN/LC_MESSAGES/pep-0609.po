msgid ""
"This document describes a governance model for the Python Packaging "
"Authority (PyPA). The model is closely based on existing informal "
"practices, with the intent of providing clarity into the functioning of "
"the PyPA and formalizing transparent processes for the PyPA."
msgstr ""
"本文件描述了 Python Packaging Authority（PyPA）的管理模式。"
"该模型紧密地基于现有的非正式实践，目的是使 PyPA 的运作更加清晰，并使 PyPA 的透明过程正规化。"

#: ../../pep-0609.rst:29
msgid ""
"The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a collaborative community that "
"maintains and advances many of the relevant projects in Python packaging."
" The software and standards developed through the PyPA are used to "
"package, share, and install Python software and to interact with indexes "
"of downloadable Python software such as `PyPI`_, the Python Package "
"Index."
msgstr ""
#  "Python Packaging Authority（PyPA）是一个协作社区，它维护并推进 Python 包方面的许多相关项目。"

#: ../../pep-0609.rst:36
msgid ""
"Currently, the PyPA is an informal and loosely defined organization that "
"lacks true authority, and the inclusion of a given project under the PyPA"
" umbrella or the creation of new projects has been done in an ad-hoc, "
"one-off manner. Similarly, individual membership in the PyPA is not well-"
"defined."
msgstr ""
"目前，PyPA是一个非正式的、定义松散的组织，缺乏真正的权威，将某个项目纳入 PyPA 的保护伞或创建新项目都是以临时的、一次性的方式进行的。"
"同样，PyPA 的个人成员资格也没有明确的定义"。

#: ../../pep-0609.rst:42
msgid ""
"While this model has more or less worked for the PyPA in the past, it "
"results in an organization which is missing certain features of a stable "
"ecosystem, namely a clear and transparent decision-making process. This "
"PEP seeks to rectify this by defining a governance model for the PyPA."
msgstr ""
"虽然这种模式在过去或多或少对 PyPA 起了作用，"
"但它导致一个组织缺少一个稳定的生态系统的某些特征，即一个清晰和透明的决策过程。"
"本项目旨在通过为 PyPA 定义一个管理模式来纠正这一问题"。

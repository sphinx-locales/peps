"Demonstrates why the changes described in the stackless PEP are "
"desirable.  A low-level continuations module exists.  With it, coroutines"
" and generators and \"green\" threads can be written.  A higher level "
"module that makes coroutines and generators easy to create is desirable "
"(and being worked on).  The focus of this PEP is on showing how "
"coroutines, generators, and green threads can simplify common programming"
" problems."

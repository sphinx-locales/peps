"This PEP proposes syntactic sugar for use of the ``super`` type to "
"automatically construct instances of the super type binding to the class "
"that a method was defined in, and the instance (or class object for "
"classmethods) that the method is currently acting upon."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:40
msgid ""
"The current usage of super requires an explicit passing of both the class"
" and instance it must operate from, requiring a breaking of the DRY "
"(Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. This hinders any change in class name, and "
"is often considered a wart by many."
msgstr ""

msgid "Specification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:49
msgid ""
"Within the specification section, some special terminology will be used "
"to distinguish similar and closely related concepts. \"super class\" will"
" refer to the actual builtin class named \"super\". A \"super instance\" "
"is simply an instance of the super class, which is associated with "
"another class and possibly with an instance of that class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:55
msgid "The new ``super`` semantics are only available in Python 3.0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:57
msgid ""
"Replacing the old usage of super, calls to the next class in the MRO "
"(method resolution order) can be made without explicitly passing the "
"class object (although doing so will still be supported). Every function "
"will have a cell named ``__class__`` that contains the class object that "
"the function is defined in."

msgid "The new syntax::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:67
msgid "is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:71
msgid ""
"where ``__class__`` is the class that the method was defined in, and "
"``<firstarg>`` is the first parameter of the method (normally ``self`` "
"for instance methods, and ``cls`` for class methods). For functions "
"defined outside a class body, ``__class__`` is not defined, and will "
"result in runtime ``SystemError``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:77
msgid ""
"While ``super`` is not a reserved word, the parser recognizes the use of "
"``super`` in a method definition and only passes in the ``__class__`` "
"cell when this is found.  Thus, calling a global alias of ``super`` "
"without arguments will not necessarily work."

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:99
msgid ""
"It was considered that it might be a problem that instantiating super "
"instances the classic way, because calling it would lookup the __call__ "
"attribute and thus try to perform an automatic super lookup to the next "
"class in the MRO. However, this was found to be false, because calling an"
" object only looks up the __call__ method directly on the object's type. "
"The following example shows this in action."
msgstr ""

"In any case, this issue goes away entirely because classic calls to "
"``super(<class>, <instance>)`` are still supported with the same meaning."

#: ../../pep-3135.txt:138
msgid ""
"The proposal adds a dynamic attribute lookup to the super type, which "
"will automatically determine the proper class and instance parameters. "
"Each super attribute lookup identifies these parameters and performs the "
"super lookup on the instance, as the current super implementation does "
"with the explicit invocation of a super instance upon a class and "
"instance."

msgid ""
"The __super__ attribute is mentioned in this PEP in several places, and "
"could be a candidate for the complete solution, actually using it "
"explicitly instead of any super usage directly. However, double-"

"This solution only solves the problem of the type indication, does not "
"handle differently named super methods, and is explicit about the name of"
" the instance. It is less flexible without being able to enacted on other"
" method names, in cases where that is needed. One use case this fails is "
"where a base- class has a factory classmethod and a subclass has two "
"factory classmethods, both of which needing to properly make super calls "
"to the one in the base- class."

"There has been the proposal that directly calling ``super(*p, **kw)`` "

"two methods would be equivalent:"

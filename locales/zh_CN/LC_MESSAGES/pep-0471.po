msgid ""
"This PEP proposes including a new directory iteration function, "
"``os.scandir()``, in the standard library. This new function adds useful "
"functionality and increases the speed of ``os.walk()`` by 2-20 times "
"(depending on the platform and file system) by avoiding calls to "
"``os.stat()`` in most cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:26
msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:28
msgid ""
"Python's built-in ``os.walk()`` is significantly slower than it needs to "
"be, because -- in addition to calling ``os.listdir()`` on each directory "
"-- it executes the ``stat()`` system call or ``GetFileAttributes()`` on "
"each file to determine whether the entry is a directory or not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:34
msgid ""
"But the underlying system calls -- ``FindFirstFile`` / ``FindNextFile`` "
"on Windows and ``readdir`` on POSIX systems -- already tell you whether "
"the files returned are directories or not, so no further system calls are"
" needed. Further, the Windows system calls return all the information for"
" a ``stat_result`` object on the directory entry, such as file size and "
"last modification time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:41
msgid ""
"In short, you can reduce the number of system calls required for a tree "
"function like ``os.walk()`` from approximately 2N to N, where N is the "
"total number of files and directories in the tree. (And because directory"
" trees are usually wider than they are deep, it's often much better than "
"this.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:47
msgid ""
"In practice, removing all those extra system calls makes ``os.walk()`` "
"about **8-9 times as fast on Windows**, and about **2-3 times as fast on "
"POSIX systems**. So we're not talking about micro- optimizations. See "
"more `benchmarks here`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:54
msgid ""
"Somewhat relatedly, many people (see Python `Issue 11406`_) are also keen"
" on a version of ``os.listdir()`` that yields filenames as it iterates "
"instead of returning them as one big list. This improves memory "
"efficiency for iterating very large directories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:59
msgid ""
"So, as well as providing a ``scandir()`` iterator function for calling "
"directly, Python's existing ``os.walk()`` function can be sped up a huge "
"amount."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:67
msgid "Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:69
msgid ""
"The implementation of this proposal was written by Ben Hoyt (initial "
"version) and Tim Golden (who helped a lot with the C extension module). "
"It lives on GitHub at `benhoyt/scandir`_. (The implementation may lag "
"behind the updates to this PEP a little.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:76
msgid ""
"Note that this module has been used and tested (see \"Use in the wild\" "
"section in this PEP), so it's more than a proof-of-concept. However, it "
"is marked as beta software and is not extensively battle-tested. It will "
"need some cleanup and more thorough testing before going into the "
"standard library, as well as integration into ``posixmodule.c``."

"Specifically, this PEP proposes adding a single function to the ``os`` "

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:96

"It returns a generator instead of a list, so that ``scandir`` acts as a "
"true iterator instead of returning the full list immediately."

msgid ""
"``scandir()`` yields a ``DirEntry`` object for each file and sub-"
"directory in ``path``. Just like ``listdir``, the ``'.'`` and ``'..'`` "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:155
msgid ""
"Like the other functions in the ``os`` module, ``scandir()`` accepts "

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:188
msgid ""
"Or, for getting the total size of files in a directory tree, showing use "
"of the ``DirEntry.stat()`` method and ``DirEntry.path`` attribute::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:202
msgid ""
"This also shows the use of the ``follow_symlinks`` parameter to "
"``is_dir()`` -- in a recursive function like this, we probably don't want"
" to follow links. (To properly follow links in a recursive function like "
"this we'd want special handling for the case where following a symlink "
"leads to a recursive loop.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:208
msgid ""
"Note that ``get_tree_size()`` will get a huge speed boost on Windows, "
"because no extra stat call are needed, but on POSIX systems the size "
"information is not returned by the directory iteration functions, so this"
" function won't gain anything there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:215
msgid "Notes on caching"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:217
msgid ""
"The ``DirEntry`` objects are relatively dumb -- the ``name`` and ``path``"
" attributes are obviously always cached, and the ``is_X`` and ``stat`` "
"methods cache their values (immediately on Windows via ``FindNextFile``, "
"and on first use on POSIX systems via a ``stat`` system call) and never "
"refetch from the system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:223
msgid ""
"For this reason, ``DirEntry`` objects are intended to be used and thrown "
"away after iteration, not stored in long-lived data structured and the "
"methods called again and again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:227
msgid ""
"If developers want \"refresh\" behaviour (for example, for watching a "
"file's size change), they can simply use ``pathlib.Path`` objects, or "
"call the regular ``os.stat()`` or ``os.path.getsize()`` functions which "
"get fresh data from the operating system every call."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:236
msgid ""
"``DirEntry.is_X()`` and ``DirEntry.stat()`` are explicitly methods rather"
" than attributes or properties, to make it clear that they may not be "
"cheap operations (although they often are), and they may do a system "
"call. As a result, these methods may raise ``OSError``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:241
msgid ""
"For example, ``DirEntry.stat()`` will always make a system call on POSIX-"
"based systems, and the ``DirEntry.is_X()`` methods will make a ``stat()``"
" system call on such systems if ``readdir()`` does not support ``d_type``"
" or returns a ``d_type`` with a value of ``DT_UNKNOWN``, which can occur "
"under certain conditions or on certain file systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:248

"Often this does not matter -- for example, ``os.walk()`` as defined in "
"the standard library only catches errors around the ``listdir()`` calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:252
msgid ""
"Also, because the exception-raising behaviour of the ``DirEntry.is_X`` "
"methods matches that of ``pathlib`` -- which only raises ``OSError`` in "
"the case of permissions or other fatal errors, but returns False if the "
"path doesn't exist or is a broken symlink -- it's often not necessary to "
"catch errors around the ``is_X()`` calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0471.txt:258

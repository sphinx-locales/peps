"PEP 409 introduced support for the ``raise exc from None`` construct to "
"allow the display of the exception context to be explicitly suppressed. "
"This PEP retains the language level changes already implemented in PEP "
"409, but replaces the underlying implementation mechanism with a simpler "
"approach based on a new ``__suppress_context__`` attribute on all "
"``BaseException`` instances."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0415.txt:37
msgid ""
"PEP 409 changes ``__cause__`` to be ``Ellipsis`` by default. Then if "
"``__cause__`` is set to ``None`` by ``raise exc from None``, no context "
"or cause will be printed should the exception be uncaught."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0415.txt:41
msgid ""
"The main problem with this scheme is it complicates the role of "
"``__cause__``. ``__cause__`` should indicate the cause of the exception "
"not whether ``__context__`` should be printed or not. This use of "
"``__cause__`` is also not easily extended in the future. For example, we "
"may someday want to allow the programmer to select which of "
"``__context__`` and ``__cause__`` will be printed. The PEP 409 "
"implementation is not amenable to this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0415.txt:48
msgid ""
"The use of ``Ellipsis`` is a hack. Before PEP 409, ``Ellipsis`` was used "
"exclusively in extended slicing. Extended slicing has nothing to do with "
"exceptions, so it's not clear to someone inspecting an exception object "
"why ``__cause__`` should be set to ``Ellipsis``. Using ``Ellipsis`` by "
"default for ``__cause__`` makes it asymmetrical with ``__context__``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0415.txt:56
msgid "Proposal"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0415.txt:58
msgid ""
"A new attribute on ``BaseException``, ``__suppress_context__``, will be "
"introduced. Whenever ``__cause__`` is set, ``__suppress_context__`` will "
"be set to ``True``. In particular, ``raise exc from cause`` syntax will "
"set ``exc.__suppress_context__`` to ``True``. Exception printing code "
"will check for that attribute to determine whether context and cause will"
" be printed. ``__cause__`` will return to its original purpose and "
"values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0415.txt:66
msgid ""
"There is precedence for ``__suppress_context__`` with the "
"``print_line_and_file`` exception attribute."

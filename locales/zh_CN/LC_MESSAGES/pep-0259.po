"Currently, the ``print`` statement always appends a newline, unless a "
"trailing comma is used.  This means that if we want to print data that "
"already ends in a newline, we get two newlines, unless special "
"precautions are taken."

"In order to avoid having to add yet another magic variable to file "

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:34
msgid ""
"When printing data that resembles the lines read from a file using a "

"While there are easy work-arounds, this is often noticed only during "
"testing and requires an extra edit-test roundtrip; the fixed code is "

msgid "Proposed Solution"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:58
msgid ""
"In the ``PRINT_ITEM`` opcode in ``ceval.c``, when a string object is "
"printed, a check is already made that looks at the last character of that"
" string.  Currently, if that last character is a whitespace character "
"other than space, the softspace flag is reset to zero; this suppresses "
"the space between two items if the first item is a string ending in "
"newline, tab, etc. (but not when it ends in a space).  Otherwise the "
"softspace flag is set to one."

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:66

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:72

"``0`` -- if the last object written is a string ending in a whitespace "
"character that's neither space nor newline"

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:75

"``1`` -- in all other cases (including the case when the last object "
"written is an empty string or not a string)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:78
msgid ""
"Then, the ``PRINT_NEWLINE`` opcode, printing of the newline is suppressed"
" if the value of softspace is negative; in any case the softspace flag is"
" reset to zero."

msgid "Scope"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0259.txt:86
msgid ""
"This only affects printing of 8-bit strings.  It doesn't affect Unicode, "
"although that could be considered a bug in the Unicode implementation.  "
"It doesn't affect other objects whose string representation happens to "
"end in a newline character."

msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:25
msgid ""
"The aim of this PEP is to standardize the high-level structure of "
"docstrings: what they should contain, and how to say it (without touching"
" on any markup syntax within docstrings).  The PEP contains conventions, "
"not laws or syntax."

"\"A universal convention supplies all of maintainability, clarity, "
"consistency, and a foundation for good programming habits too. What it "
"doesn't do is insist that you follow it against your will. That's "
"Python!\""

"If you violate these conventions, the worst you'll get is some dirty "
"looks.  But some software (such as the Docutils_ docstring processing "
"system [1]_ [2]_) will be aware of the conventions, so following them "
"will get you the best results."

msgid "What is a Docstring?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:49
msgid ""
"A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a "
"module, function, class, or method definition.  Such a docstring becomes "
"the ``__doc__`` special attribute of that object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:53
msgid ""
"All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and "
"classes exported by a module should also have docstrings.  Public methods"
" (including the ``__init__`` constructor) should also have docstrings.  A"
" package may be documented in the module docstring of the ``__init__.py``"
" file in the package directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:59
msgid ""
"String literals occurring elsewhere in Python code may also act as "
"documentation.  They are not recognized by the Python bytecode compiler "
"and are not accessible as runtime object attributes (i.e. not assigned to"
" ``__doc__``), but two types of extra docstrings may be extracted by "
"software tools:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:65
msgid ""
"String literals occurring immediately after a simple assignment at the "
"top level of a module, class, or ``__init__`` method are called "
"\"attribute docstrings\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:69
msgid ""
"String literals occurring immediately after another docstring are called "
"\"additional docstrings\"."

"Please see PEP 258, \"Docutils Design Specification\" [2]_, for a "
"detailed description of attribute and additional docstrings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For consistency, always use ``\"\"\"triple double quotes\"\"\"`` around "
"docstrings.  Use ``r\"\"\"raw triple double quotes\"\"\"`` if you use any"
" backslashes in your docstrings.  For Unicode docstrings, use "
"``u\"\"\"Unicode triple-quoted strings\"\"\"``."

"One-liners are for really obvious cases.  They should really fit on one "

"Triple quotes are used even though the string fits on one line. This "
"makes it easy to later expand it."

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:101
msgid ""
"The closing quotes are on the same line as the opening quotes.  This "
"looks better for one-liners."

msgid "There's no blank line either before or after the docstring."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:106
msgid ""
"The docstring is a phrase ending in a period.  It prescribes the function"
" or method's effect as a command (\"Do this\", \"Return that\"), not as a"
" description; e.g. don't write \"Returns the pathname ...\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:110
msgid ""
"The one-line docstring should NOT be a \"signature\" reiterating the "
"function/method parameters (which can be obtained by introspection). "
"Don't do::"

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:117
msgid ""
"This type of docstring is only appropriate for C functions (such as "
"built-ins), where introspection is not possible.  However, the nature of "
"the *return value* cannot be determined by introspection, so it should be"
" mentioned.  The preferred form for such a docstring would be something "
"like::"

msgid "Multi-line Docstrings"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:132
msgid ""
"Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a one-line "
"docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more elaborate "
"description.  The summary line may be used by automatic indexing tools; "
"it is important that it fits on one line and is separated from the rest "
"of the docstring by a blank line.  The summary line may be on the same "
"line as the opening quotes or on the next line.  The entire docstring is "
"indented the same as the quotes at its first line (see example below)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:141
msgid ""
"Insert a blank line after all docstrings (one-line or multi-line) that "
"document a class -- generally speaking, the class's methods are separated"
" from each other by a single blank line, and the docstring needs to be "
"offset from the first method by a blank line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:146
msgid ""
"The docstring of a script (a stand-alone program) should be usable as its"
" \"usage\" message, printed when the script is invoked with incorrect or "
"missing arguments (or perhaps with a \"-h\" option, for \"help\"). Such a"
" docstring should document the script's function and command line syntax,"
" environment variables, and files.  Usage messages can be fairly "
"elaborate (several screens full) and should be sufficient for a new user "
"to use the command properly, as well as a complete quick reference to all"
" options and arguments for the sophisticated user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:155
msgid ""
"The docstring for a module should generally list the classes, exceptions "
"and functions (and any other objects) that are exported by the module, "
"with a one-line summary of each.  (These summaries generally give less "
"detail than the summary line in the object's docstring.)  The docstring "
"for a package (i.e., the docstring of the package's ``__init__.py`` "
"module) should also list the modules and subpackages exported by the "
"package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:163
msgid ""
"The docstring for a function or method should summarize its behavior and "
"document its arguments, return value(s), side effects, exceptions raised,"
" and restrictions on when it can be called (all if applicable). Optional "
"arguments should be indicated.  It should be documented whether keyword "
"arguments are part of the interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:169
msgid ""
"The docstring for a class should summarize its behavior and list the "
"public methods and instance variables.  If the class is intended to be "
"subclassed, and has an additional interface for subclasses, this "
"interface should be listed separately (in the docstring).  The class "
"constructor should be documented in the docstring for its ``__init__`` "
"method.  Individual methods should be documented by their own docstring."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:177
msgid ""
"If a class subclasses another class and its behavior is mostly inherited "
"from that class, its docstring should mention this and summarize the "
"differences.  Use the verb \"override\" to indicate that a subclass "
"method replaces a superclass method and does not call the superclass "
"method; use the verb \"extend\" to indicate that a subclass method calls "
"the superclass method (in addition to its own behavior)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:184
msgid ""
"*Do not* use the Emacs convention of mentioning the arguments of "
"functions or methods in upper case in running text.  Python is case "
"sensitive and the argument names can be used for keyword arguments, so "
"the docstring should document the correct argument names.  It is best to "
"list each argument on a separate line.  For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../pep-0257.txt:201
msgid ""
"Unless the entire docstring fits on a line, place the closing quotes on a"
" line by themselves.  This way, Emacs' ``fill-paragraph`` command can be "

msgid "Handling Docstring Indentation"

msgid ""
"Docstring processing tools will strip a uniform amount of indentation "
"from the second and further lines of the docstring, equal to the minimum "
"indentation of all non-blank lines after the first line.  Any indentation"
" in the first line of the docstring (i.e., up to the first newline) is "
"insignificant and removed.  Relative indentation of later lines in the "
"docstring is retained.  Blank lines should be removed from the beginning "
"and end of the docstring."

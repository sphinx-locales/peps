#: ../../pep-0370.txt:24
msgid ""
"Current Python versions don't have a unified way to install packages into"
" the home directory of a user (except for Mac Framework builds). Users "
"are either forced to ask the system administrator to install or update a "

"The feature can't be implemented using the environment variable "

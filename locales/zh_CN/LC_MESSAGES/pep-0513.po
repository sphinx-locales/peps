"**Rejected alternatives:** We also considered using a configuration file,"

"single filesystem might contain many different interpreter environments, "
"each with their own ABI profile -- the ``manylinux1`` compatibility of a "
"system-installed x86_64 CPython might not tell us much about the "
"``manylinux1`` compatibility of a user-installed i686 PyPy. Locating this"

"[\"manylinux1_x86_64\", \"centos5_x86_64\", \"linux_x86_64\"]``. However,"

"to distinguish between the state of \"doesn't support ``manylinux1``\" "
"(or eventually ``manylinux2``, etc.) versus \"doesn't specify either way "
"whether it supports ``manylinux1``\", which is not entirely obvious in "
"the above representation; and, it's not at all clear what features are "
"really needed vis a vis preference ordering given that right now the only"
" possible platform tags are ``manylinux1`` and ``linux``.  So we're "

"Linux gets more platform tags."

"more likely to introduce confusing bugs than actually help the user. (For"
" example: different distributions vary in where they actually put these "
"libraries, and if our checking code failed to use the correct path search"

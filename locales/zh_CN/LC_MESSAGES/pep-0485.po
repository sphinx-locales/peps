"Floating point values contain limited precision, which results in their "

"accumulate with repeated computation.  As a result, it is common advice "
"to only use an equality comparison in very specific situations. Often an "
"inequality comparison fits the bill, but there are times (often in "
"testing) where the programmer wants to determine whether a computed value"
" is \"close\" to an expected value, without requiring them to be exactly "
"equal. This is common enough, particularly in testing, and not always "
"obvious how to do it, that it would be useful addition to the standard "
